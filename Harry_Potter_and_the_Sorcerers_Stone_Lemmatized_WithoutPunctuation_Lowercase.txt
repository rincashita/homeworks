imagine thing could all this have anything to do with the potter if it do if it get out that they be relate to a pair of‚êwell he didnt think he could bear it the dursleys get into bed mr dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turn it all over in his mind his last comforting think before he fell asleep be that even if the potter be involve there be no reason for them to come near him

ground and highheeled buckle boot his blue eye be light bright and sparkle behind halfmoon spectacle and his nose be very long and crook a though it have be break at least twice this man name be albus dumbledore albus dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he have just arrive in a street where everything from his name to his boot be unwelcome he be busy rummage in his cloak look for something but he do seem to realize he be be watch because he look up suddenly at the cat which be still star at him from the other end of the street for some reason the sight of the cat seem to amuse him he chuckle and mutter ‚i should have known‚ he find what he be look for in his inside pocket it seem to be a silver cigarette lighter he flick it open hold it up in the air and click it the near street lamp go out with a little pop he click it again‚êthe next lamp flicker into darkness twelve time he click the putouter until the only light leave on the whole street be two tiny pinprick in the distance which be the eye of the cat watch him if anyone look out of their window now even beadyeyed mr dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that be happen down on the pavement dumbledore slip the putouter back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sit down on the wall next to the cat he didnt look at it but after a moment he speak to it ‚fancy see you here professor mcgonagall‚ he turn to smile at the tabby but it have go instead he be smile at a rather severelooking woman who be wear square glass exactly the shape of the marking the cat have have around it eye she too be wear a cloak an emerald one her black hair be draw into a tight bun she look distinctly ruffle ‚how do you know it be me‚ she ask ‚my dear professor i ve never see a cat sit so stiffly‚ ‚youd be stiff if youd be sit on a brick wall all day‚ say professor mcgonagall ‚all day when you could have be celebrate i must have pass a dozen feast and party on my way here‚ professor mcgonagall sniff angrily ‚oh yes everyones celebrate all right‚ she say impatiently ‚youd think theyd be a bit more careful but no‚êeven the muggles have notice somethings go on it be on their news‚ she jerk her head back at the dursleys dark livingroom window ‚i hear it flock of owl shoot star well theyre not completely stupid they be bind to notice something shoot star down in kent‚êill bet that be dedalus diggle he never have much sense‚ ‚you cant blame them‚ say dumbledore gently ‚weve have precious little to celebrate for eleven years‚ ‚i know that‚ say professor mcgonagall irritably ‚but thats no reason to lose our head people be be downright careless out on the street in broad daylight not even dress in muggle clothes swap rumors‚ she throw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here a though hop he be go to tell her something but he didnt so she go on ‚a fine thing it would be if on the very day youknowwho seem to have disappear at last the muggles find out about u all i suppose he really have go dumbledore‚ ‚it certainly seem so‚ say dumbledore ‚we have much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon drop‚ ‚a what‚ ‚a lemon drop theyre a kind of muggle sweet im rather fond of‚ ‚no thank you‚ say professor mcgonagall coldly a though she didnt think this be the moment for lemon drop ‚as i say even if youknowwho have go ‚ ‚my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this youknowwho nonsense‚êfor eleven year i have be try to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort‚ professor mcgonagall flinch but dumbledore who be unsticking two lemon drop seem not to notice ‚it all get so confusing if we keep say youknowwho i have never see any reason to be frighten of say voldemorts name ‚i know you haven t say professor mcgonagall sound half exasperate half admire ‚but youre different everyone know youre the only one youknowoh all right voldemort be frighten of‚ ‚you flatter me‚ say dumbledore calmly ‚voldemort have power i will never have‚ ‚only because youre too‚êwell‚ênoble to use them‚ ‚its lucky it dark i havent blush so much since madam pomfrey tell me she like my new earmuffs‚ professor mcgonagall shoot a sharp look at dumbledore and say ‚the owl be nothing next to the rumor that be fly around you know what everyones say about why he disappear about what finally stop him‚ it seem that professor mcgonagall have reach the point she be most anxious to discuss the real reason she have be wait on a cold hard wall all day for neither a a cat nor a a woman have she fix dumbledore with such a pierce stare a she do now it be plain that whatever ‚everyone‚ be say she be not go to believe it until dumbledore tell her it be true dumbledore however be choose another lemon drop and do not answer ‚what theyre saying‚ she press on ‚is that last night voldemort turn up in godrics hollow he go to find the potter the rumor be that lily and james potter are‚êare‚êthat theyre‚êdead ‚ dumbledore bow his head professor mcgonagall gasp ‚lily and james i cant believe it i didnt want to believe it oh albus‚ dumbledore reach out and pat her on the shoulder ‚i know i know‚ he say heavily professor mcgonagalls voice tremble a she go on ‚thats not all theyre say he try to kill the potter son harry but‚êhe couldnt he couldnt kill that little boy no one know why or how but theyre say that when he couldnt kill harry potter voldemorts power somehow broke‚êand thats why he go dumbledore nodded glumly ‚its‚êits true‚ falter professor mcgonagall ‚after all he do all the people he kill he couldnt kill a little boy it just astounding of all the thing to stop him but how in the name of heaven do harry survive‚ ‚we can only guess‚ say dumbledore ‚we may never know‚ professor mcgonagall pull out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eye beneath her spectacle dumbledore give a great sniff a he take a golden watch from his pocket and examine it it be a very odd watch it have twelve hand but no number instead little planet be move around the edge it must have make sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and say ‚hagrids late i suppose it be he who tell you id be here by the way‚ ‚yes‚ say professor mcgonagall ‚and i dont suppose youre go to tell me why youre here of all places‚ ‚ive come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle theyre the only family he have leave now‚ ‚you dont mean‚êyou cant mean the people who live here‚ cry professor mcgonagall jumping to her foot and point at number four ‚dumbledore‚êyou cant ive be watch them all day you couldnt find two people who be less like u and theyve get this son‚êi saw him kick his mother all the way up the street scream for sweet harry potter come and live here‚ ‚its the best place for him‚ say dumbledore firmly ‚his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he older ive write them a letter‚ ‚a letter‚ repeat professor mcgonagall faintly sit back down on the wall ‚really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter these people will never understand him hell be famous‚êa legend‚êi wouldnt be surprise if today be know a harry potter day in the future‚êthere will be book write about harry‚êevery child in our world will know his name‚ ‚exactly‚ say dumbledore look very seriously over the top of his halfmoon glass ‚it would be enough to turn any boy head famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he wont even remember cara you see how much good off hell be grow up away from all that until he ready to take it‚ professor mcgonagall open her mouth change her mind swallowed and then say ‚yes‚êyes youre right of course but how be the boy get here dumbledore‚ she eye his cloak suddenly a though she think he might be hide harry underneath it ‚hagrids bring him‚ ‚you think it‚êwise‚êto trust hagrid with something as important a this‚ i would trust hagrid with my life‚ say dumbledore ‚im not say his heart isnt in the right place‚ say professor mcgonagall grudgingly ‚but you cant pretend he not careless he do tend to‚êwhat be that‚ a low rumbling sound have break the silence around them it grow steadily louder a they look up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swell to a roar a they both look up at the sky‚êand a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and land on the road in front of them if the motorcycle be huge it be nothing to the man sit astride it he be almost twice as tall a a normal man and at least five time a wide he look simply too big to be allow and so wild‚êlong tangle of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he have hand the size of trash can lids and his foot in their leather boot be like baby dolphin in his vast muscular arm he be hold a bundle of blanket ‚hagrid‚ say dumbledore sound relieve ‚at last and where do you get that motorcycle‚ ‚borrowed it professor dumbledore sit‚ say the giant climb carefully off the motorcycle a he speak ‚young sirius black lent it to me ive get him sir‚ ‚no problem be there‚ ‚no sir‚êhouse be almost destroy but i get him out all right before the muggles start swarmin around he fell asleep a we be flyin over bristol‚ dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blanket inside just visible be a baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning ‚is that where ‚ whisper professor mcgonagall ‚yes‚ say dumbledore ‚hell have that scar forever‚ ‚couldnt you do something about it dumbledore‚ ‚even if i could i wouldnt scar can come in handy i have one myself above my left knee that be a perfect map of the london underground well‚êgive him here hagrid‚êwed good get this over with‚ dumbledore take harry in his arm and turn toward the dursleys house ‚could i‚êcould i say goodbye to him sir‚ ask hagrid he bend his great shaggy head over harry and give him what must have be a very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog ‚shhh‚ hiss professor mcgonagall ‚youll wake the muggles‚ ‚sssorry‚ sob hagrid take out a large spotted handkerchief and bury his face in it ‚but i cccant stand it‚êlily an james dead‚êan poor little harry off ter live with muggles ‚ ‚yes yes it all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or well be found‚ professor mcgonagall whisper pat hagrid gingerly on the arm a dumbledore step over the low garden wall and walk to the front door he lay harry gently on the doorstep take a letter out of his cloak tuck it inside harrys blanket and then come back to the other two for a full minute the three of them stand and look at the little bundle hagrids shoulder shake professor mcgonagall blink furiously and the twinkling light that usually shine from dumbledores eye seem to have go out ‚well‚ say dumbledore finally ‚thats that weve no business stay here we may as well go and join the celebrations‚ ‚yeah‚ say hagrid in a very muffled voice ‚ill be takin sirius his bike back gnight professor mcgonagall‚êprofessor dumbledore sir‚ wipe his stream eye on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kick the engine into life with a roar it rise into the air and off into the night ‚i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall‚ say dumbledore nod to her professor mcgonagall blow her nose in reply dumbledore turn and walk back down the street on the corner he stop and take out the silver putouter he click it once and twelve ball of light speed back to their street lamp so that privet drive glow suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slink around the corner at the other end of the street he could just see the bundle of blanket on the step of number four ‚good luck harry‚ he murmur he turn on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he be go a breeze ruffle the neat hedge of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonish thing to happen harry potter roll over inside his blanket without wake up one small hand close on the letter beside him and he sleep on not know he be special not know he be famous not know he would be wake in a few hour time by mrs dursleys scream a she open the front door to put out the milk bottle nor that he would spend the next few week be prod and pinch by his cousin dudley he couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country be hold up their glass and say in hushed voice ‚to harry potter‚êthe boy who lived‚ chapter two the vanish glass nearly ten year have pass since

with nerve and ron he saw looked pale under his freckle they cram their pocket with the last of the sweet and join the crowd throng the corridor the train slow right down and finally stop people push their way toward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform harry shiver in the cold night air then a lamp come bobbing over the head of the student and harry hear a familiar voice ‚firs year fir year over here all right there harry‚ hagrids big hairy face beam over the sea of head ‚cmon follow me‚êany more firs year mind yer step now firs year follow me‚ slipping and stumble they follow

which it stand ‚heads down‚ yell hagrid a the first boat reach the cliff they all bend their head and the little boat carry them through a curtain of ivy that hide a wide opening in the cliff face they be carry along a dark tunnel which seem to be take them right underneath the castle until they reach a kind of underground harbor where they clamber out onto rock and pebble ‚oy you there be this your toad‚ say hagrid who be check the boat a people climb out of them ‚trevor‚ cry neville blissfully hold out his hand then they clamber up a passageway in the rock after hagrids lamp come out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle they walk up a flight of stone step and crowd around the huge oak front door ‚everyone here you there still get yer toad‚ hagrid raise a gigantic fist and knock three time on the castle door chapter seven the sort hat the door swung open at once a tall blackhaired witch in emeraldgreen robe stand there she have a very stern face and

face them lead to the upper floor they follow professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor harry could hear the drone of hundred of voice from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here‚êbut professor mcgonagall show the first year into a small empty chamber off the hall they crowd in stand rather closer together than they would usually have do peer about nervously ‚welcome to hogwarts‚ say professor mcgonagall ‚the startofterm banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seat in the great hall you will be sort into your house the sorting be a very

ready for you‚ say professor mcgonagall ‚please wait quietly‚ she leave the chamber harry swallow ‚how exactly do they sort u into houses‚ he ask ron ‚some sort of test i think fred say it hurt a lot but i think he be joking‚ harrys heart give a horrible jolt a test in front of the whole school but he didnt know any magic yet‚êwhat on earth would he have to do he hadnt expect something like this the moment they arrive he look around anxiously and saw that everyone else look terrify too no one be talk much except hermione granger who be whisper very fast about all the spell shed learn and wonder which one shed need harry try hard not to listen to her hed never be more nervous never not even when hed have to take a school report home to the dursleys say that hed somehow turn his teacher wig blue he keep his eye fix on the door any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doom then something happen that make him jump about a foot in the air‚êseveral people behind him scream ‚what the ‚ê‚ he gasp so do the people around him about twenty ghost have just stream through the back wall pearlywhite and slightly transparent they glide across the room talk to one another and hardly glance at the first year they seem to be argue what look like a fat little monk be say ‚forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance ‚ê‚ ‚my dear friar havent we give peeve all the chance he deserve he give u all a bad name and you know he not really even a ghost‚êi say what be you all do here‚ a ghost wear a ruff and tights have suddenly notice the first year nobody answer ‚new students‚ say the fat friar smile around at them ‚about to be sort i suppose‚ a few people nod mutely ‚hope to see you in hufflepuff‚ say the friar ‚my old house you know‚ ‚move along now‚ say a sharp voice ‚the sorting ceremony about to start‚ professor mcgonagall have return one by one the ghost float away through the opposite wall ‚now form a line‚ professor mcgonagall tell the first year ‚and follow me‚ feel oddly a though his leg have turn to lead harry get into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walk out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double door into the great hall harry have never even imagine such a strange and splendid place it be light by thousand and thousand of candle that be float in midair over four long table where the rest of the student be sit these table be lay with glitter golden plate and goblet at the top of the hall be another long table where the teacher be sit professor mcgonagall lead the first year up here so that they come to a halt in a line face the other student with the teacher behind them the hundred of face star at them look like pale lantern in the flickering candlelight dot here and there among the student the ghost shine misty silver mainly to avoid all the star eye harry look upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dot with star he hear hermione whisper ‚its bewitch to look like the sky outside i read about it in hogwarts a history‚ it be hard to believe there be a ceiling there at all and that the great hall didnt simply open on to the heaven harry quickly look down again a professor mcgonagall silently place a fourlegged stool in front of the first year on top of the stool she put a pointed wizard hat this hat be patch and fray and extremely dirty aunt petunia wouldnt have let it in the house maybe they have to try and get a rabbit out of it harry think wildly that seem the sort of thing‚ênoticing that everyone in the hall be now star at the hat he star at it too for a few second there be complete silence then the hat twitch a rip near the brim open wide like a mouth‚êand the hat begin to sing ‚oh you may not think im pretty but dont judge on what you see ill eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me you can keep your bowler black your top hat sleek and tall for im the hogwarts sort hat and i can cap them all there nothing hide in your head the sort hat cant see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to be you might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they be just and loyal those patient hufflepuffis be true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if youve a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin youll make your real friend those cunning folk use any mean to achieve their end so put me on dont be afraid and dont get in a flap youre in safe hand though i have none for im a thinking cap‚ the whole hall burst into applause a the hat finish it song it bow to each of the four table and then become quite still again ‚so weve just get to try on the hat‚ ron whisper to harry ‚ill kill fred he be go on about wrestle a troll‚ harry smile weakly yes try on the hat be a lot good than have to do a spell but he do wish they could have try it on without everyone watch the hat seem to be ask rather alot harry didnt feel brave or quickwitted or any of it at the moment if only the hat have mention a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have be the one for him professor mcgonagall now stepped forward hold a long roll of parchment ‚when i call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted‚ she say ‚abbott hannah‚ a pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtail stumble out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eye and sit down a moment pause ‚ê ‚hufflepuff‚ shout the hat the table on the right cheer and clap a hannah go to sit down at the hufflepuff table harry saw the ghost of the fat friar wave merrily at her ‚bones susan‚ ‚hufflepuff‚ shout the hat again and susan scuttle off to sit next to hannah ‚boot terry‚ ‚ravenclaw‚ the table second from the left clap this time several ravenclaws stand up to shake hand with terry a he join them ‚ brocklehurst mandy‚ go to ravenclaw too but ‚brown lavender‚ become the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left explode with cheer harry could see ron twin brother catcall ‚bulstrode millicent‚ then become a slytherin perhaps it be harrys imagination after all hed heard about slytherin but he think they look like an unpleasant lot he be start to feel definitely sick now he remember be pick for team during gym at his old school he have always be last to be choose not because he be no good but because no one want dudley to think they like him ‚finchfletchley justin‚ ‚hufflepuff‚ sometimes harry notice the hat shout out the house at once but at others it take a little while to decide ‚finnigan seamus‚ the sandyhaired boy next to harry in the line sit on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declare him a gryffindor ‚granger hermione‚ hermione almost run to the stool and jam the hat eagerly on her head ‚gryffindor‚ shout the hat ron groan a horrible thought struck harry a horrible thought always do when youre very nervous what if he wasnt choose at all what if he just sit there with the hat over his eye for age until professor mcgonagall jerk it off his head and say there have obviously be a mistake and hed good get back on the train when neville longbottom the boy who keep lose his toad be call he fell over on his way to the stool the hat take a long time to decide with neville when it finally shout ‚gryffindor‚ neville run off still wear it and have to jog back amid gale of laughter to give it to ‚macdougal morag‚ malfoy swagger forward when his name be call and get his wish at once the hat have barely touch his head when it scream ‚slytherin‚ malfoy go to join his friend crabbe and goyle look pleased with himself there werent many people leave now ‚moon‚ ‚nott‚ ‚parkinson‚ then a pair of twin girl ‚patil‚ and ‚patil‚ then ‚perks sallyanne‚ and then at last‚ê‚potter harry‚ a harry step forward whisper suddenly break out like little hissing fire all over the hall ‚potter do she say‚ the harry potter‚ the last thing harry saw before the hat drop over his eye be the hall full of people crane to get a good look at him next second he be look at the black inside of the hat he wait hmm‚ say a small voice in his ear ‚difficult very difficult plenty of courage i see not a bad mind either there talent a my goodness yes‚êand a nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interest so where shall i put you‚ harry grip the edge of the stool and think not slytherin not slytherin ‚not slytherin eh‚ say the small voice ‚are you sure you could be great you know it all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that‚êno well if youre sure‚êbetter be gryffindor‚ harry hear the hat shout the last word to the whole hall he take off the hat and walk shakily toward the gryffindor table he be so relieve to have be choose and not put in slytherin he hardly notice that he be get the loud cheer yet percy the prefect get up and shake his hand vigorously while the weasley twin yell ‚we get potter we get potter‚ harry sit down opposite the ghost in the ruff hed see earlier the ghost pat his arm

interest ‚ive never asked‚ say nearly headless nick delicately when everyone have eat as much a they could the remains of the food fade from the plate leave them sparkle clean a before a moment later

their last few line with his wand and when they have finish he be one of those who clap loud ‚ah music‚ he say wipe his eye ‚a magic beyond all we do here and now bedtime off you trot‚ the gryffindor first year follow percy through the chattering crowd out of the great hall and up the marble staircase harrys leg be like lead again but only because he be so tired and full of food he be too sleepy even to be surprise that the people in the portrait along the corridor whisper and point a they pass or that twice percy lead them through doorway hide behind slide panel and hang tapestry they climb more staircase yawn and drag their foot and harry be just wonder how much farther they have to go when they come to a sudden halt a bundle of walk stick be float in midair ahead of them and a percy take a step toward them they start throw themselves at him ‚peeves‚ percy whisper to the first year ‚a poltergeist‚ he raise his voice ‚peeves‚êshow yourself‚ a loud rude sound like the air be let out of a balloon answer ‚do you want me to go to the bloody baron‚ there be a pop and a little man with wicked dark eye and a wide mouth appear float crosslegged in the air clutch the walking stick ‚oooooooh‚ he say with an evil cackle ‚ickle firsties what fun‚ he swoop suddenly at them they all duck ‚go away peeve or the baronll hear about this i mean it‚ bark percy peeve stick out his tongue and vanish drop the walk stick on nevilles head they hear him zoom away rattle coat of armor a he pass ‚you want to watch out for peeves‚ say percy a they set off again ‚the bloody barons the only one who can control him he wont even listen to u prefect here we are‚ at the very end of the corridor hang a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress ‚password‚ she say ‚caput draconis‚ say percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall they all scramble through it‚êneville need a leg up‚êand find themselves in the gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchair percy direct the girl through one door to their dormitory and the boy through another at the top of a spiral staircase‚êthey be obviously in one of the towers‚êthey find their bed at last five fourposters hung with deep red velvet curtain their trunk have already be bring up too tire to talk much they pull on their pajama and fell into bed ‚ great food isnt it‚ ron mutter to harry through the hanging ‚get off scabbers he chew my sheets‚ harry be go to ask ron if hed have any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once perhaps harry have eat a bit too much because he have a very strange dream he be wear professor quirrells turban which keep talk to him tell him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it be his destiny harry tell the turban he didnt want to be in slytherin it get heavier and heavier he try to pull it off but it tighten painfully‚êand there be malfoy laughing at him a he struggle with it then malfoy turn into the hooknosed teacher snape whose laugh become high and cold‚êthere be a burst of green light and harry wake sweat and shake he roll over and fell asleep again and when he wake next day he didnt remember the dream at all chapter eight the potion master there look‚ ‚where‚ ‚next to the tall kid with the red hair‚ ‚wearing the glasses‚ ‚did you see his face‚ ‚did you see his scar‚ whisper follow harry from the moment he leave his dormitory the next day people line up outside classroom stand on tiptoe to get a look at him or double back to pass him in the corridor again star harry wish they wouldnt because he be try to concentrate on find his way to class there be a hundred and fortytwo staircase at hogwarts wide sweeping one narrow rickety one some that lead somewhere different on a friday some with a vanish step halfway up that you have to remember to jump then there be door that wouldnt open unless you ask politely or tickle them in exactly the right place and door that werent really door at all but solid wall just pretend it be also very hard to remember where anything be because it all seem to move around a lot the people in the portrait keep go to visit each other and harry be sure the coat of armor could walk the ghost didnt help either it be always a nasty shock when one of them glide suddenly through a door you be try to open nearly headless nick be always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeve the poltergeist be worth two locked door and a trick staircase if you meet him when you be late for class he would drop wastepaper basket on your head pull rug from under your foot pelt you with bit of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech ‚got your conk‚ even bad than peeve if that be possible be the caretaker argus filch harry and ron manage to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning filch find them try to force their way through a door that unluckily turn out to be the entrance to the outofbounds corridor on the third floor he wouldnt believe they be lose be sure they be try to break into it on purpose and be threaten to lock them in the dungeon when they be rescue by professor quirrell who be pass filch own a cat call mr norris a scrawny dustcolored creature with bulge lamp like eye just like filchs she patrol the corridor alone break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and shed whisk off for filch whod appear wheeze two second later filch know the secret passageway of the school well than anyone except perhaps the weasley twin and could pop up as suddenly a any of the ghost the student all hat him and it be the dear ambition of many to give mr norris a good kick and then once you have manage to find them there be the class themselves there be a lot more to magic a harry quickly find out than wave your wand and say a few funny word they have to study the night sky through their telescope every wednesday at midnight and learn the name of different star and the movement of the planet three time a week they go out to the greenhouse behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch call professor sprout where they learn how to take care of all the strange

to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking‚ he begin he speak in barely more than a whisper but they catch every word‚êlike professor mcgonagall snape have y catch every word‚êlike professor mcgonagall snape have the gift of keep a class silent without effort ‚as there be little foolish wandwaving here many of you will hardly believe this be magic i dont expect you will really

‚i dont know‚ say harry quietly ‚i think hermione do though why dont you try her‚ a few people laugh harry caught seamuss eye and seamus wink snape however be not pleased ‚sit down‚ he snap at hermione ‚for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it be know a the draught of live death a bezoar be a stone take from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poison a for monkshood and wolfsbane they be the same plant which also go by the name of aconite well why arent you all copy that down‚ there be a sudden rummaging for quill and parchment over the noise snape say ‚and a point will be take from gryffindor house for your cheek potter‚ thing didnt improve for the gryffindors a the potion lesson continued snape put them all into pair and set them to mix up a simple potion to cure boil he sweep around in his long black cloak watch them weigh dry nettle and crush snake fang criticize almost everyone except malfoy whom he seem

add the porcupine quills before take the cauldron off the fire‚ neville whimper a boil start to pop up all over his nose ‚take him up to the hospital wing‚ snape spat at seamus then he round on harry and ron who have be work next to neville ‚you‚êpotter‚êwhy didnt you tell him not to add the quill think hed make you look good if he get it wrong do you thats another point youve lose for gryffindor‚

hour later harry mind be race and his spirit be low hed lose two point for gryffindor in his very first week‚êwhy do snape hate him so much ‚cheer up‚ say ron ‚snapes always take point off fred and

her‚êfitch put her up to it‚ harry tell hagrid about snapes lesson hagrid like ron tell harry not to worry about it that snape like hardly any of the student ‚but he seem to really hate me‚ ‚rubbish‚ say hagrid ‚why should he‚ yet harry couldnt help thinking that hagrid didnt quite meet his eye when he say that ‚hows yer brother charlie‚ hagrid ask ron ‚i like him a lot‚êgreat with animals‚ harry

clanging and crashing be enough to wake the whole castle ‚run‚ harry yell and the four of them sprint down the gallery not look back to see whether filch be following‚êthey swung around the doorpost and gallop down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they be or where they be going‚êthey rip through a tapestry and find themselves in a hidden passageway hurtle along

into bed the dog be guard something what have hagrid say gringotts be the safe place in the world for something you want to hide‚êexcept perhaps hogwarts it look a though harry have find out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen be chapter ten halloween malfoy couldnt believe his eye when he saw that harry and ron be still at hogwarts the next day look tire but perfectly cheerful indeed by the next morning harry and ron think that meet the threeheaded dog have be an excellent adventure and they be quite keen to have another one in the meantime harry fill ron in about the package that seem to have be move from gringotts to hogwarts and they spend a lot of time wonder what could possibly need such heavy protection ‚its either really valuable or really dangerous‚ say ron ‚or both‚ say harry but a all they know for sure about the mysterious object be that it be about two inch long they didnt have much chance of guess what it be without further clue neither neville nor hermione show the slight interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor all neville care about be never go near the dog again hermione be now refuse to speak to harry and ron but she be such a bossy knowitall that they saw this a an added bonus all they really want now be a way of get back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrive in the mail about a week later a the owl flood into the great hall a usual everyones attention be catch at once by a long thin package carry by six large screech owl harry be just as interested a everyone else to see

halfway across the entrance hall they find the way upstairs bar by crabbe and goyle malfoy seize the package from harry and felt it ‚thats a broomstick‚ he say throw it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face ‚youll be in for it this time potter first year arent allow them‚ ron couldnt resist it ‚its not any old broomstick‚ he say ‚its a nimbus two thousand what do you say youve get at home malfoy a comet two sixty‚ ron grin at harry ‚comets look flashy but theyre not in the same league a the nimbus‚ ‚what would you know about it weasley you couldnt afford half the

send a broomstick professor‚ say malfoy quickly ‚yes yes thats right‚ say professor flitwick beaming at harry ‚professor mcgonagall tell me all about the special circumstance potter and what model be it‚ ‚a nimbus two thousand sit‚ say harry fight not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoys face ‚and it really thanks to malfoy here that ive get it‚ he add harry and ron head upstairs smother their laughter at malfoys obvious rage and confusion ‚well it true‚ harry chortle a they reach the top of the marble staircase ‚if he hadnt steal nevilles remembrall i woulnt be on the team‚ ‚so i suppose you think thats a reward for break rules‚ come an angry voice from just behind them hermione be stomp up the stair look disapprovingly at the package in harrys hand ‚i thought you werent speak to us‚ say harry ‚yes dont stop now‚ say ron ‚its do u so much good‚ hermione march away with her nose in the air harry have a lot of trouble keep his mind on his lesson that day it keep wander up to the dormitory where his new broomstick be lie under his bed or stray off to the quidditch field where hed be learn to play that night he bolt his dinner that even without notice what he be eat and then rush upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last ‚wow‚ ron sigh a the broomstick roll onto harrys bedspread even harry who know nothing about the different broom think it look wonderful sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it have a long tail of neat straight twig and nimbus two thousand write in gold near the top a seven oclock draw near harry leave the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field hold never be inside the stadium before hundred of seat be raise in stand around the field so that the spectator be high enough to see what be go on at either end of the field be three golden pole with hoop on the end they remind harry of the little plastic stick muggle child blow bubble through except that they be fifty foot high too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mount his broomstick and kick off from the ground what a feeling‚êhe swoop in and out of the goal post and then speed up and down the field the nimbus two thousand turn wherever he want at his light touch ‚hey potter come down oliver wood have arrive fie be carry a large wooden crate under his arm harry land next to him ‚very nice‚ say wood his eye glint ‚i see what mcgonagall meant you really be a natural im just go to teach you the rule this evening then youll be join team practice three time a week‚ he open the crate inside be four differentsized ball ‚right‚ say wood ‚now quidditch be easy enough to understand even if it not too easy to play there be seven player on each side three of them be call chasers‚ ‚three chasers‚ harry repeat a wood take out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball ‚this ball call the quaffle‚ say wood ‚the chaser throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoop to score a goal ten point every time the quaffle go through one of the hoop follow me‚ ‚the chaser throw the quaffle and put it through the hoop to score‚ harry recite ‚so‚êthats sort of like basketball on broomstick with six hoop isnt it‚ ‚whats basketball‚ say wood curiously ‚never mind‚ say harry quickly ‚now theres another player on each side who call the keeper im keeper for gryffindor i have to fly around our hoop and stop the other team from scoring‚ ‚three chaser one keeper‚ say harry who be determine to remember it all ‚and they play with the quaffle okay get that so what be they for‚ he point at the three ball leave inside the box ‚ill show you now‚ say wood ‚take this‚ he hand harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat ‚im go to show you what the bludgers do‚ wood say ‚these two be the bludgers‚ he show harry two identical ball jet black and slightly small than the red quaffle harry notice that they seem to be strain to escape the strap hold them inside the box ‚stand back‚ wood warn harry he bend down and free one of the bludgers at once the black ball rise high in the air and then pelt straight at harrys face harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from break his nose and send it zigzag away into the air‚êit zoom around their head and then shot at wood who dive on top of it and manage to pin it to the ground ‚see‚ wood pant force the struggle bludger back into the crate and strap it down safely ‚the bludgers rocket around try to knock player off their broom thats why you have two beater on each team‚êthe weasley twin be ours‚êits their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team so‚êthink youve get all that‚ ‚three chaser try and score with the quaffle the keeper guard the goal post the beater keep the bludgers away from their team‚ harry reel off ‚very good‚ say wood ‚er‚êhave the bludgers ever kill anyone‚ harry ask hop he sound offhand ‚never at hogwarts weve have a couple of broken jaw but nothing bad than that now the last member of the team be the seeker thats you and you dont have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open‚ ‚dont worry the weasleys be more than a match for the bludgers‚êi mean theyre like a pair of human bludgers themselves‚ wood reach into the crate and take out the fourth and last ball compare with the quaffle and the bludgers it be tiny about the size of a large walnut it be bright gold and have little fluttering silver wing ‚this‚ say wood ‚is the golden snitch and it the most important ball of the lot it very hard to catch because it so fast and difficult to see it the seeker job to catch it youve get to weave in and out of the chaser beater bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other team seeker because whichever seeker catch the snitch win his team an extra hundred and fifty point so they nearly always win thats why seeker get foul so much a game of quidditch only end when the snitch be catch so it can go on for ages‚êi think the record be three month they have to keep bring on substitute so the player could get some sleep ‚well thats it‚êany questions‚ harry shake his head he understand what he have to do all right it be do it that be go to be the problem ‚we wont practice with the snitch yet‚ say wood carefully shut it back inside the crate ‚its too dark we might lose it let try you out with a few of these‚ he pull a bag of ordinary golf ball out of his pocket and a few minute later he and harry be up in the air wood throw the golf ball as hard a he could in every direction for harry to catch harry didnt miss a single one and wood be delight after half an hour night have really fall and they couldnt carry on ‚that quidditch cupll have our name on it this year‚ say wood happily a they trudge back up to the castle ‚i wouldnt be surprise if you turn out good than charlie weasley and he could have play for england if he hadnt go off chase dragons‚ perhaps it be because he be now so busy what with quidditch practice three evening a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realize that hed already be at hogwarts two month the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever have his lesson too be become more and more interesting now that they have master the basic on halloween morning they wake to the delicious smell of bake pumpkin waft through the corridor even well professor flitwick announce in charm that he think they be ready to start make object fly something they have all be die to try since theyd see him make nevilles toad zoom around the classroom professor flitwick put the class into pair to practice harrys partner be seamus finnigan which be a relief because neville have be try to catch his eye ron however be to be work with hermione granger it be hard to tell whether ron or hermione be angrier about this she hadnt speak to either of them since the day harry broomstick have arrive ‚now dont forget that nice wrist movement weve be practicing‚ squeak professor flitwick perch on top of his pile of book a usual ‚swish and flick remember swish and flick and say the magic word properly be very important too‚ênever forget wizard baruffio who say s instead of f and find himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest‚ it be very difficult harry and seamus swish and flick but the feather they be suppose to be send skyward just lay on the desktop seamus get so impatient that he prod it with his wand and set fire to it‚êharry have to put it out with his hat ron at the next table wasnt have much more luck ‚wingardium leviosa‚ he shout wave his long arm like a windmill ‚youre say it wrong‚ harry heard hermione snap ‚its winggardium leviosa make the gar nice and long‚ ‚you do it then if youre so clever‚ ron snarl hermione roll up the sleeve of her gown flick her wand and say ‚wingardium leviosa‚ their feather rise off the desk and hover about four foot above their head ‚oh well done‚ cry professor flitwick clap ‚everyone see here miss granger do it‚ ron be in a very bad mood by the end of the class ‚its no wonder no one can stand her‚ he say to harry a they push their way into the crowded corridor ‚shes a nightmare honestly ‚ someone knock into harry a they hurry past him it be hermione harry catch a glimpse of her face‚êand be startle to see that she be in tear ‚i think she hear you‚ ‚so‚ say ron but he look a bit uncomfortable ‚she mustve notice shes get no friends‚ hermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt see all afternoon on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil tell her friend lavender that hermione be cry in the girl bathroom and want to be leave alone ron look still more awkward at this but a moment later they have enter the great hall where the halloween decoration put hermione out of their mind a thousand live bat flutter from the wall and ceiling while a thousand more swoop over the table in low black cloud make the candle in the pumpkin stutter the feast appear suddenly on the golden plate a it have at the startofterm banquet harry be just help himself to a bake potato when professor quirrell come sprint into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face everyone star a he reach professor dumbledores chair slump against the table and gasp ‚troll‚êin the dungeons‚êthought you ought to know‚ he then sink to the floor in a dead faint there be an uproar it take several purple firecracker explode from the end of professor dumbledores wand to bring silence ‚prefects‚ he rumble ‚lead your house back to the dormitory immediately‚ percy be in his element ‚follow me stick together first year no need to fear the troll if you follow my order stay close behind me now make way first year come through excuse me im a prefect‚ ‚how could a troll get in‚ harry ask a they climb the stair ‚dont ask me theyre suppose to be really stupid‚ say ron ‚maybe peeve let it in for a halloween joke‚ they pass different group of people hurry in different direction a they jostle their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grabbed ron arm ‚ive just thought‚êhermione‚ ‚what about her‚ ‚she doesnt know about the troll‚ ron bite his lip ‚oh all right‚ he snap ‚but percyd well not see us‚ duck down they join the hufflepuffs go the other way slip down a deserted side corridor and hurry off toward the girl bathroom they have just turn the corner when they hear quick footstep behind them ‚percy‚ hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffin peer around it however they saw not percy but snape he cross the corridor and disappear from view ‚whats he doing‚ harry whisper ‚why isnt he down in the dungeon with the rest of the teachers‚ ‚search me‚ quietly a possible they creep along the next corridor after snapes fade footstep ‚hes head for the third floor‚ harry say but ron hold up his hand ‚can you smell something‚ harry sniffed and a foul stench reach his nostril a mixture of old sock and the kind of public toilet no one seem to clean and then they hear it‚êa low grunting and the shuffle footfall of gigantic foot ron pointed‚êat the end of a passage to the left something huge be move toward them they shrink into the shadow and watch a it emerge into a patch of moonlight it be a horrible sight twelve foot tall it skin be a dull granite gray it great lumpy body like a boulder with it small bald head perch on top like a coconut it have short leg thick a tree trunk with flat horny foot the smell come from it be incredible it be hold a huge wooden club which drag along the floor because it arm be so long the troll stop next to a doorway and peer inside it waggle it long ear make up it tiny mind then slouch slowly into the room ‚the key in the lock‚ harry mutter ‚we could lock it in‚ ‚good idea‚ say ron nervously they edge toward the open door mouth dry pray the troll wasnt about to come out of it with one great leap harry manage to grab the key slam the door and lock it yes‚ flush with their victory they start to run back up the passage but a they reach the corner they hear something that make their heart stop‚êa high petrify scream‚êand it be come from the chamber theyd just chain up ‚oh no‚ say ron pale a the bloody baron ‚its the girl bathroom‚ harry gasp ‚hermione‚ they say together it be the last thing they want to do but what choice do they have wheel around they sprint back to the door and turn the key fumbling in their panic harry pull the door open and they run inside hermione granger be shrink against the wall opposite look a if she be about to faint the troll be advance on her knock the sink off the wall a it go ‚confuse it‚ harry say desperately to ron and seize a tap he throw it as hard a he could against the wall the troll stop a few foot from hermione it lumber around blink stupidly to see what have make the noise it mean little eye saw harry it hesitate then make for him instead lift it club a it go ‚oy peabrain‚ yell ron from the other side of the chamber and he throw a metal pipe at it the troll didnt even seem to notice the pipe hit it shoulder but it hear the yell and pause again turn it ugly snout toward ron instead give harry time to run around it ‚come on run run‚ harry yell at hermione try to pull her toward the door but she couldnt move she be still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror the shouting and the echo seem to be drive the troll berserk it roar again and start toward ron who be near and have no way to escape harry then do something that be both very brave and very stupid he take a great running jump and manage to fasten his arm around the troll neck from behind the troll couldnt feel harry hang there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up it nose and harrys wand have still be in his hand when hed jumped‚êit have go straight up one of the troll nostrils howl with pain the troll twist and flail it club with harry cling on for dear life any second the troll be go to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club hermione have sink to the floor in fright ron pull out his own wand‚ênot know what he be go to do he hear himself cry the first spell that come into his head ‚wingardium leviosa‚ the club fly suddenly out of the troll hand rise high high up into the air turn slowly over‚êand drop with a sicken crack onto it owner head the troll sway on the spot and then fell flat on it face with a thud that make the whole room tremble harry get to his foot he be shake and out of breath ron be stand there with his wand still raise star at what he have do it be hermione who speak first ‚is it‚êdead‚ i dont think so‚ say harry i think it just be knock out‚ he bend down and pull his wand out of the troll nose it be cover in what look like lumpy gray glue ‚urgh‚êtroll boogers‚ he wipe it on the troll trousers a sudden slamming and loud footstep make the three of them look up they hadnt realize what a racket they have be make but of course someone downstairs must have hear the crash and the troll roar a moment later professor mcgonagall have come bursting into the room closely follow by snape with quirrell bring up the rear quirrell take one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sit quickly down on a toilet clutch his heart snape bent over the troll professor mcgonagall be look at ron and harry harry have never see her look so angry her lip be white hope of win fifty point for gryffindor fade quickly from harrys mind ‚what on earth be you think of‚ say professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice harry look at ron who be still stand with his wand in the air ‚youre lucky you werent kill why arent you in your dormitory‚ snape give harry a swift piercing look harry look at the floor he wish ron would put his wand down then a small voice come out of the shadow ‚please professor mcgonagall‚êthey be look for me‚ ‚miss granger‚ hermione have manage to get to her foot at last i go look for the troll because i‚êi thought i could deal with it on my own‚êyou know because ive read all about them‚ ron drop his wand hermione granger tell a downright lie to a teacher ‚if they hadnt find me id be dead now harry stick his wand up it nose and ron knock it out with it own club they didnt have time to come and fetch anyone it be about to finish me off when they arrived‚ harry and ron try to look a though this story wasnt new to them ‚well‚êin that case‚ say professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them ‚miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackle a mountain troll on your own‚ hermione hang her head harry be speechless hermione be the last person to do anything against the rule and here she be pretend she have to get them out of trouble it be a if snape have start hand out sweet ‚miss granger five point will be take from gryffindor for this‚ say professor mcgonagall ‚im very disappoint in you if youre not

first year could have take on a fullgrown mountain troll you each win gryffindor five point professor dumbledore will be inform of this you may go‚ they hurry out of the chamber and didnt speak at all until they have climb two floor up it be a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything else ‚we should have get more than ten points‚ ron grumble ‚five you mean once shes take off hermiones‚ ‚good of her to get u out of trouble like that‚ ron admit ‚mind you we do save her‚ ‚she might not have need save if we hadnt lock the thing in with her‚ harry remind him they have reach the portrait of the fat lady ‚pig snout‚ they say and enter the common room be pack and noisy everyone be eat the food that have be send up hermione however stand alone by the door wait for them there be a very embarrassed pause then none of them look at each other they all say ‚thanks‚ and hurry off to get plate but from that moment on hermione granger become their friend there be some thing

if gryffindor win they would move up into second place in the house championship hardly anyone have see harry play because wood have decide that a their secret weapon harry should be keep well secret but the news that he be play seeker have leak out somehow and harry didnt know which be worse‚êpeople tell him hed be brilliant or people tell him theyd be run around underneath him hold a mattress it be really lucky that harry now have hermlone a a friend he didnt know how hed have get through all his homework without her what with all the lastminute quidditch practice wood be make them do she have also tent him quidditch through the age which turn out to be a very interesting read harry learn that there be seven hundred way of commit a quidditch foul and that all of them have happen during a world cup match in 1473 that seeker be usually the small and fast player and that most serious quidditch accident seem to happen to them that although people rarely die play quidditch referee have be know to vanish and turn up month later in the sahara desert hermione have become a bit more relaxed about break rule since harry and ron have save her from the mountain troll and she be much nicer

harry mutter angrily a snape limp away ‚wonder whats wrong with his leg‚ ‚dunno but i hope it really hurt him‚ say ron bitterly the gryffindor common room be very noisy that even harry ron and hermione sit together next to a window hermione be check harry and ron charm homework for them she would never let them copy ‚how will you learn‚ but by ask her to read it through they get the right answer anyway harry felt restless he want quidditch through the age back to take his mind off his nerve about tomorrow why should he be afraid of snape get up he tell ron and hermione he be go to ask snape if he could have it ‚better you than me‚ they say together but harry have an idea that snape wouldnt refuse if there be other teacher listen he make his way down to the staffroom and knock there

leave before snape could take any more point from gryffindor he sprint back upstairs ‚did you get it‚ ron ask a harry join them ‚whats the matter‚ in a low whisper harry tell them what hed see ‚you

magical name of our time he be miss too from important modern magical discovery and a study of recent development in wizardry and then of course there be the sheer size of the library ten of thousand of book thousand of shelf hundred of narrow row hermione take out a list of subject and title she have decide to search while ron stride off down a row of book and start pull them off the shelf at random harry wander over to the restricted section he have be wonder for a while if flamel wasnt somewhere in there unfortunately you need a specially sign note from one of the teacher to look in any of the restrict book and he know hed never get one these be the book contain powerful dark magic never teach at hogwarts and only read by old student study advanced defense against the dark art ‚what be you look for boy‚ ‚nothing‚ say harry madam pince the librarian brandish a feather duster at him ‚youd well get out then go on‚êout‚ wish hed be a bit quicker at think up some story harry leave the library he ron and hermione have already agree theyd well not ask madam pince where they could find flamel they be sure shed be able to tell them but they couldnt risk snape hear what they be up to harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two have find anything but he wasnt very hopeful they have be look for two week after a but a they only have odd moment between lesson it wasnt surprising theyd find nothing what they really need be a nice long search without madam pince breathe down their neck five minute later ron and hermione join him shake their head they go off to lunch ‚you will keep look while im away wont you‚ say hermione ‚and send me an owl if you find anything‚ ‚and you could ask your parent if they know who flamel is‚ say ron ‚itd be safe to ask them‚ ‚very safe a theyre both dentists‚ say hermione once the holiday have start ron and harry be have too good a time to think much about flamel they have the dormitory to themselves and the common room be far

luminous balloon a growyourownwarts kit and his own new wizard chess set the white mouse have disappear and harry have a nasty feeling they be go to end up a mr norriss christmas dinner harry and the weasleys spend a happy afternoon have a furious snowball fight on the ground then cold wet and gasp for breath they return to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry break in his new chess set by lose spectacularly to ron he suspect he wouldnt have lose so badly if percy hadnt try to help him so much after a meal of turkey sandwich crumpet trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because theyd steal his prefect badge it have be harrys best christmas day ever yet something have be nag at the back of his mind all day not until he climb into bed be he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever have send it ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon a hed drawn the curtain of his fourposter harry lean over the side of his own bed and pull the cloak out from under it his father this have be his father he let the material flow over his hand smoother than silk light a air use it well the note have say he have to try it now he slip out of bed and wrap the cloak around himself look down at his leg he saw only moonlight and shadow it be a very funny feeling use it well suddenly harry felt wideawake the whole of hogwarts be open to him in this cloak excitement flood through him a he stand there in the dark and silence he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know ron grunt in his sleep should harry wake him something hold him back‚êhis father cloak‚êhe felt that this time‚êthe first time‚êhe want to use it alone he creep out of the dormitory down the stair across the common room and climb through the portrait hole ‚whos there‚ squawk the fat lady harry say nothing he walk quickly down the corridor where should he go he stop his heart racing and thought and then it come to him the restrict section in the library hed be able to read as long a he like as long a it take to find out who flamel be he set off draw the invisibility cloak tight around him a he walk the library be pitchblack and very eerie harry light a lamp to see his way along the row of book the lamp look a if it be float along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm support it the sight give him the creep the restricted section be right at the back of the library step ping carefully over the rope that separate these book from the rest of the library he hold up his lamp to read the title they didnt tell him much their peeling fade gold letter spell word in language harry couldnt understand some have no title at all one book have a dark stain on it that look horribly like blood the hair on the back of harrys neck prickle maybe he be imagine it maybe not but he think a faint whispering be come from the book a though they know someone be there who shouldnt be he have to start somewhere set the lamp down carefully on the floor he look along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book a large black and silver volume catch his eye he pull it out with difficulty because it be very heavy and balance it on his knee let it fall open a pierce bloodcurdling shriek split the silence‚êthe book be scream harry snap it shut but the shriek go on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note he stumble backward and knock over his lamp which go out at once panic he hear footsteps come down the corridor outside‚êstuffing the shriek book back on the shelf he run for it he pass filch in the doorway filchs pale wild eye look straight through him and harry slip under filchs outstretched arm and streak off up the corridor the book shriek still ring in his ear he come to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor he have be so busy get away from the library he hadnt pay attention to where he be go perhaps because it be dark he didnt recognize where he be at all there be a suit of armor near the kitchen he know but he must be five floor above there ‚you ask me to come directly to you professor if anyone be wander around at night and somebody be in the library restrict section‚ harry felt the blood drain out of his face wherever he be filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice be get nearer and to his horror it be snape who reply ‚the restricted section well they cant be far well catch them‚ harry stand root to the spot a filch and snape come around the corner ahead they couldnt see him of course but it be a narrow corridor and if they come much near theyd knock right into him‚êthe cloak didnt stop him from be solid he back away as quietly a he could a door stand ajar to his left it be his only hope he squeeze through it hold his breath try not to move it and to his relief he manage to get inside the room without their noticing anything they walk straight past and harry lean against the wall breathing deeply listen to their footstep die away that have be close very close it be a few second before he notice anything about the room he have hide in it look like an unused classroom the dark shape of desk and chair be pile against the wall and there be an upturned wastepaper basket‚êbut prop against the wall face him be something that didnt look a if it belong there something that look a if someone have just put it there to keep it out of the way it be a magnificent mirror as high a the ceiling with an ornate gold frame stand on two clawed foot there be an inscription carve around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi his panic fading now that there be no sound of filch and snape harry move nearer to the mirror want to look at himself but see no reflection again he step in front of it he have to clap his hand to his mouth to stop himself from scream he whirl around his heart be pound far more furiously than when the book have screamed‚êfor he have see not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people stand right behind him but the room be empty breathing very fast he turn slowly back to the mirror there he be reflect in it white and scaredlooking and there reflect behind him be at least ten others harry look over his shoulder‚êbut still no one be there or be they all invisible too be he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror trick be that it reflect them invisible or not he look in the mirror again a woman stand right behind his reflection be smile at him and wave he reach out a hand and felt the air behind him if she be really there hed touch her their reflection be so close together but he felt only air‚êshe and the others exist only in the mirror she be a very pretty woman she have dark red hair and her eyes‚êher eye be just like mine harry think edge a little close to the glass bright green‚êexactly the same shape but then he notice that she be cry smile but cry at the same time the tall thin blackhaired man stand next to her put his arm around her he wear glass and his hair be very untidy it stick up at the back just a harrys do harry be so close to the mirror now that his nose be nearly touch that of his reflection ‚mom‚ he whisper ‚dad‚ they just look at him smile and slowly harry look into the face of the other people in the mirror and saw other pair of green eye like his other nose like his even a little old man who look a though he have harry knobbly knees‚êharry be look at his family for the first time in his life the potter smile and wave at harry and he star hungrily back at them his hand press flat against the glass a though he be hop to fall right through it and reach them he have a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness how long he stand there he didnt know the reflection do not fade and he look and look until a distant noise bring him back to his sens he couldnt stay here he have to find his way back to bed he tear his eye away from his mother face whisper ‚ill come back‚ and hurry from the room ‚you could have wake me up‚ say ron crossly ‚you can come tonight im go back i want to show you the mirror ‚id like to see your mom and dad‚ ron say eagerly ‚and i want to see all your family all the weasleys youll be able to show me your other brother

head dog be guard what do it matter if snape steal it really ‚are you all right‚ say ron ‚you look odd‚ what harry fear most be that he might not be able to find the mirror room again with ron cover in the cloak too they have to walk much more slowly the next night they try retrace harrys route from the library wandering around the dark passageway for nearly an hour ‚im freezing‚ say ron ‚lets forget it and go back‚ ‚no‚ harry hiss i know it here somewhere‚ they pass the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else just a ron start moan that his foot be dead with cold harry spot the suit of armor ‚its here‚êjust here‚êyes‚ they push the door open harry drop the cloak from around his shoulder and run to the mirror there they be his mother and father beam at the sight of him ‚see‚ harry whisper ‚i cant see anything‚ ‚look look at them all there be load of them‚ ‚i can only see you‚ ‚look in it properly go on stand where i am‚ harry step aside but with

yourself all last night give me a bit more time‚ ‚youre only hold the quidditch cup whats interest about that i want to see my parents‚ ‚dont push me ‚ê‚ a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion they hadnt realize how loudly they have be talk ‚quick‚ ron throw the cloak back over them a the luminous eye of mrs norris come round the door ron and harry stand quite still both think the same thing‚êdid the cloak work on cat after what seem an age she turn and leave ‚this isnt safe‚êshe might have go for filch i bet she hear u come on‚ and ron pull harry out of the room

might not have be quite truthful but then he think a he shove scabbers off his pillow it have be quite a personal question chapter thirteen nicolas flamel dumbledore have convince harry not to go look for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holiday the invisibility cloak stay fold at the bottom of his trunk harry wish he could forget what hed see in the mirror a easily but he couldnt he start have nightmare over and over again he dream about his parent disappear in a flash of green light while a high voice cackle with laughter ‚you see dumbledore be right that mirror could drive you mad‚ say ron when harry tell him about these drearns hermione who come back the day before term start take a different view of thing she be tear between horror at the idea of harry be out of bed roam the school three night in a row ‚if filch have catch you‚ and disappointment that he hadnt at least find out who nicolas flamel be they have almost give up hope of ever find flamel in a library book even though harry be still sure hed read the name somewhere once term have start they be back to skim through book for ten minute during their break harry have even less time than the other two because quidditch practice have start again wood be work the team harder than ever even the endless rain that have replace the snow couldnt dampen his spirit the weasleys complain that wood be become a fanatic but harry be on wood side if they win their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven year quite apart from want to win harry find that he have few nightmare when he be tire out after train then during one particularly wet and muddy practice session wood give the team a bit of bad news hed just get very angry with the weasleys who keep divebombing each other and pretend to fall off their broom ‚will you stop mess around‚ he yell ‚thats exactly the sort of thing thatll lose u the match snap referee this time and hell be look for any excuse to knock point off gryffindor‚ george weasley really do fall off his broom at these word ‚snapes refereeing‚ he splutter through a mouthful of mud ‚whens he ever referee a quidditch match hes not go to be fair if we might overtake slytherin‚ the rest of the team land next to george to complain too ‚its not my fault‚ say wood ‚weve just get to make sure we play a clean game so snape hasnt get an excuse to pick on us‚ which be all very well think harry but he have another reason for not want snape near him while he be play quidditch the rest of the team hang back to talk to one another a usual at the end of practice but harry head straight back to the gryffindor common room where he find ron and hermione playing chess chess be the only thing hermione ever lose at something harry and ron thought be very good for her ‚dont talk to me for a moment‚ say ron when harry sit down next to him ‚i need to concen ‚ê‚ he catch sight of harrys face ‚whats the matter with you you look terrible‚ speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry tell the other two about snapes sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch referee ‚dont play‚ say hermione at once ‚say youre ill‚ say ron ‚pretend to break your leg‚ hermione suggest ‚really break your leg‚ say ron ‚i cant‚ say harry ‚there isnt a reserve seeker if i back out gryffindor cant play at all‚ at that moment neville topple into the common room how he have manage to climb through the portrait hole be anyones guess because his leg have be stick together with what they recognize at once a the leglocker curse he must have have to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower everyone fell over laugh except hermione who leap up and perform the countercurse nevilles legs sprang apart and he get to his foot tremble ‚what happened‚ hermione ask him lead him over to sit with harry and ron ‚malfoy‚ say neville shakily ‚i meet him outside the library he say hed be look for someone to practice that on‚ ‚go to professor mcgonagall‚ hermione urge neville ‚report him‚ neville shake his head ‚i dont want more trouble‚ he mumble ‚youve get to stand up to him neville‚ say ron ‚hes use to walk all over people but thats no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier‚ ‚theres no need to tell me im not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoys already do that‚ neville choke out harry felt in the pocket of his robe and pull out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione have give him for christmas he give it to neville who look a though he might cry ‚youre worth twelve of malfoy‚ harry say ‚the sorting hat choose you for gryffindor didnt it and wheres malfoy in stink slytherin‚ nevilles lip twitch in a weak smile a he unwrap the frog ‚thanks harry i think ill go to bed dyou want the card you collect them dont you‚ a neville walk away harry look at the famous wizard card ‚dumbledore again‚ he say ‚he be the first one i ever‚ he gasp he star at the back of the card then he look up at ron and hermione ‚ive find him‚ he whisper ‚ive found flamel i tell you id read the name somewhere before i read it on the train come here‚êlisten to this dumbledore be particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945 for the discovery of the twelve us of dragon blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel‚ hermione jump to her foot she hadnt look so excited since theyd get back the mark for their very first piece of homework ‚stay there‚ she say and she sprint up the stair to the girl dormitory harry and ron barely have time to exchange mystified look before she be dash back an enormous old book in her arm ‚i never think to look in here‚ she whisper excitedly ‚i get this out of the library week ago for a bit of light reading‚ ‚light‚ say ron but hermione tell him to be quiet until shed look something up and start flick frantically through the page mutter to herself at last she find what she be look for ‚i know it i know it‚ ‚are we allow to speak yet‚ say ron grumpily hermione ignore him ‚nicolas flamel‚ she whisper dramatically ‚is the only known maker of the sorcerer stone‚ this didnt have quite the effect shed expect ‚the what‚ say harry and ron ‚oh honestly dont you two read look‚êread that there‚ she push the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy be concern with make the sorcerer stone a legendary substance with astonish power the stone will transform any metal into pure gold it also produce the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal there have be many report of the sorcerer stone over the century but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover mr flamel who celebrate his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year enjoy a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fiftyeight ‚see‚ say hermione when harry and ron have finish ‚the dog must be guard flamels sorcerer stone i bet he ask dumbledore to keep it safe for him because theyre friend and he know someone be after it thats why he want the stone move out of gringotts‚ ‚a stone that make gold and stop you from ever dying‚ say harry ‚no wonder snapes after it anyone would want it‚ ‚and no wonder we couldnt find flamel in that study of recent development in wizardry‚ say ron ‚hes not exactly recent if he six hundred and sixtyfive be he‚ the next morning in defense against the dark art while copy down different way of treat werewolf bite harry and ron be still discuss what theyd do with a sorcerer stone if they have one it wasnt until ron say hed buy his own quidditch team that harry remember about snape and the come match ‚im go to play‚ he tell ron and hermione ‚if i dont all the slytherins will think im just too scared to face snape ill show them itll really wipe the smile off their face if we win‚ ‚just as long a be not wipe you off the field‚ say hermione a the match draw nearer however harry become more and more nervous whatever he tell ron and hermione the rest of the team wasnt too calm either the idea of overtake slytherin in the house championship be wonderful no one have do it for seven year but would they be allow to with such a biased referee harry didnt know whether he be imagine it or not but he seem to keep run into snape wherever he go at time he even wonder whether snape be follow him try to catch him on his own potion lesson be turn into a sort of weekly torture snape be so horrible to harry could snape possibly know theyd find out about the sorcerer stone harry didnt see how he could‚êyet he sometimes have the horrible feeling that snape could read mind harry know when they wish him good luck outside the locker room the next afternoon that ron and hermione be wonder whether theyd ever see him alive again this wasnt what youd call comfort harry hardly hear a word of wood pep talk a he pull on his quidditch robe and pick up his nimbus two thousand ron and hermione meanwhile have find a place in the stand next to neville who couldnt understand why they look so grim and worry or why they have both bring their wand to the match little do harry know that ron and hermione have be secretly practice the leglocker curse theyd get the idea from malfoy use it on neville and be ready to use it on snape if he show any sign of want to hurt harry ‚now dont forget it locomotor mortis‚ hermione mutter a ron slip his wand up his sleeve ‚i know‚ ron snap ‚dont nag‚ back in the locker room wood have take harry aside ‚dont want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch it now finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much‚ ‚the whole school out there‚ say fred weasley peer out of the door ‚even‚êblimey‚êdumbledores come to watch‚ harrys heart do a somersault ‚dumbledore‚ he say dash to the door to make sure fred be right there be no mistaking that silver beard harry could have laugh out loud with relief he be safe there be simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore be watch perhaps that be why snape be look so angry a the team march onto the field something that ron notice too ‚ive never see snape look so mean‚ he tell hermione ‚look theyre off ouch‚ someone have poke ron in the back of the head it be malfoy ‚oh sorry weasley didnt see you there‚ malfoy grin broadly at crabbe and goyle ‚wonder how long potter go to stay on his broom this time anyone want a bet what about you weasley‚ ron didnt answer snape have just award hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley have hit a bludger at him hermione who have all her finger cross in her lap be squint fixedly at harry who be circle the game like a hawk look for the snitch ‚you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team‚ say malfoy loudly a few minute later a snape award hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all ‚its people they feel sorry for see there potter who get no parent then theres the weasleys whove get no money‚êyou should be on the team longbottom youve get no brains‚ neville go bright red but turn in his seat to face malfoy ‚im worth twelve of you malfoy‚ he stammer malfoy crabbe and goyle howl with laughter but ron still not dare to take his eye from the game say ‚you tell him neville‚ ‚longbottom if brain be gold youd be poor than weasley and thats say something‚ ron nerve be already stretch to the break point with anxiety about harry ‚im warn you malfoy‚êone more word ‚ron‚ say hermione suddenly ‚harry ‚ê‚ ‚what where‚ harry have suddenly go into a spectacular dive which draw gasp and cheer from the crowd hermione stand up her crossed finger in her mouth a harry streak toward the ground like a bullet ‚youre in luck weasley potter obviously spot some money on the ground‚ say malfoy ron snap before malfoy know what be happen ron be on top of him wrestle him to the ground neville hesitate then clamber over the back of his seat to help ‚come on harry‚ hermione scream leap onto her seat to watch a harry speed straight at snape‚êshe didnt even notice malfoy and ron roll around under her seat or the scuffle and yelp come from the whirl of fist that be neville crabbe and goyle up in the air snape turn on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him miss him by inches‚êthe next second harry have pull out of the dive his arm raise in triumph the snitch clasp in his hand the stand erupt it have to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch be catch so quickly ‚ron ron where be you the game over harrys win weve won gryffindor be in the lead‚ shriek hermione dance up and down on her seat and hug parvati patil in the row in front harry jump off his broom a foot from the ground he couldnt believe it hed do it‚êthe game be over it have barely last five minute a gryffindors come spill onto the field he saw snape land nearby whitefaced and tightlipped‚êthen harry felt a hand on his shoulder and look up into dumbledores smile face ‚well done‚ say dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear ‚nice to see you havent be brood about that mirror be keep busy excellent‚ snape spat bitterly on the ground harry leave the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed he couldnt ever remember feel happy hed really do something to be proud of now‚êno one could say he be just a famous name any more the evening air have never smell so sweet he walk over the damp grass relive the last hour in his head which be a happy blur gryffindors run to lift him onto their shoulder ron and hermione in the distance jump up and down ron cheer through a heavy nosebleed harry have reach the shed he lean against the wooden door and look up at hogwarts with it window glow red in the setting sun gryffindor in the lead hed do it hed show snape and speaking of snape a hooded figure come swiftly down the front step of the castle clearly not want to be see it walk as fast a possible toward the forbidden forest harrys victory fade from his mind a he watch he recognize the figure prowl walk snape sneak into the forest while everyone else be at dinner‚êwhat be go on harry jump back on his nimbus two thousand and take off glide silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run he follow the tree be so thick he couldnt see where snape have go he fly in circle low and low brush the top branch of tree until he hear voice he glide toward them and land noiselessly in a towering beech tree he climb carefully along one of the branch hold tight to his broomstick try to see through the leaf below in a shadowy clearing stand snape but he wasnt alone quirrell be there too harry couldnt make out the look on his face but he be stutter bad than ever harry strain to catch what they be say ‚ddont know why you want ttto meet here of all pplaces severus‚ ‚oh i think wed keep this private‚ say snape his voice icy ‚students arent suppose to know about the sorcerer stone after all‚ harry lean forward quirrell be mumble something snape interrupt him ‚have you find out how to get past that beast of hagrids yet‚ ‚bbbut severus i ‚ê‚ ‚you dont want me a your enemy quirrell‚ say snape take a step toward him ‚ii dont know what you ‚you know perfectly well what i mean‚ an owl hoot loudly and harry nearly fell out of the tree he steady himself in time to hear snape say ‚‚ê your little bit of hocuspocus im waiting‚ ‚bbut i dddont ‚ê‚ ‚very well‚ snape cut in ‚well have another little chat soon when youve have time to think thing over and decide where your loyalty lie‚ he throw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing it be almost dark now but harry could see quirrell stand quite still a though he be petrify ‚harry where have you been‚ hermione squeak ‚we win you win we won‚ shout ron thump harry on the back ‚and i give malfoy a black eye and neville try to take on crabbe and goyle singlehanded he still out cold but madam pomftey say hell be all right‚êtalk about show slytherin everyones wait for you in the common room be have a party fred and george stole some cake and stuff from the kitchens‚ ‚never mind that now‚ say harry breathlessly ‚lets find an empty room you wait til you hear this‚ he make sure peeve wasnt inside before shut the door behind them then he tell them what hed see and hear ‚so we be right it be the sorcerer stone and snapes try to force quirrell to help him get it he ask if he know how to get past fluffy‚êand he say something about quirrells hocus pocuss‚ê i reckon there be other thing guard the stone apart from fluffy load of enchantment probably and quirrell would have do some antidark art spell that snape need to break through ‚ê‚ ‚so you mean the stone only safe as long a quirrell stand up to snape‚ say hermione in alarm ‚itll be go by next tuesday‚ say ron chapter fourteen norbert the norwegian ridgeback quirrell however must have be braver than theyd think in the week that follow he do seem to be get paler and thinner but it didnt look a though hed crack yet every time they pass the thirdfloor corridor harry ron and hermione would press their ear to the door to check that fluffy be still growl inside snape be sweep about in his usual bad temper which surely mean that the stone be still safe whenever harry pass quirrell these day he give him an encourage sort of smile and ron have start tell people off for laugh at quirrells stutter hermione however have more on her mind than the sorcerer stone she have start draw up study schedule and colorcoding all her note harry and ron wouldnt have mind but she keep nag them to do the same ‚hermione the exam be age away‚ ‚ten weeks‚ hermione snap ‚thats not age thats like a second to nicolas

meet you there and take him away while it still dark send me an answer as soon a possible love charlie they look at one another ‚weve get the invisibility cloak‚ say harry ‚it shouldnt be too

hermione walk back to the castle feeling saturday couldnt come quickly enough they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time come for him to say goodbye to norbert if they hadnt be so worried about what they have to do it be a very dark cloudy night and they be a bit late arriving at hagrids hut because theyd have to wait for peeve to get out of their way in the entrance hall where hed be play tennis against the wall hagrid have norbert pack and ready in a large crate ‚hes get lot o rat an some brandy fer the journey‚ say hagrid in a muffled voice ‚an ive pack his teddy bear in case he get lonely‚ from inside the crate come rip noise that sound to harry a though the teddy be have his head tear off ‚byebye norbert‚ hagrid sob a harry and hermione cover the crate with the invisibility cloak and step underneath it themselves ‚mommy will never forget you‚ how they manage to get the crate back up to the castle they never know midnight tick nearer a they heave norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors up another staircase then another‚êeven one of harrys shortcut didnt make the work much easy ‚nearly there‚ harry pant a they reach the corridor beneath the tall tower then a sudden movement ahead of them make them almost drop the crate forgetting that they be already invisible they shrink into the shadow star at the dark outline of two people grapple with each other ten foot away a lamp flare professor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net have malfoy by the ear ‚detention‚ she shout ‚and twenty point from slytherin wander around in the middle of the night how dare you ‚ê‚ ‚you dont understand professor harry potter coming‚êhes get a dragon‚ ‚what utter rubbish how dare you tell such lie come on‚êi shall see professor snape about you malfoy‚ the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seem the easy thing in the world after that not until theyd step out into the cold night air do they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again hermione do a sort of jig ‚malfoys get detention i could sing‚ ‚dont‚ harry advise her chuckle about malfoy they wait norbert thrash about in his crate about ten minute later four broomstick come swoop down out of the darkness charlies friend be a cheery lot they show harry and hermione the harness theyd rig up so they could suspend norbert between them they all help buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hand with the others and thank them very much at last norbert be go go go they slip back down the spiral staircase their heart as light a their hand now that norbert be off them no more dragon‚êmalfoy in detention‚êwhat could spoil their happiness the answer to that be wait at the foot of the stair a they step into the corridor filchs face loom suddenly out of the darkness ‚well well well‚ he whisper ‚we be in trouble‚ theyd leave the invisibility cloak on top of the tower chapter fifteen the foribidden forest thing couldnt have be bad filch take them down to professor mcgonagalls study on the first floor where they sit and wait without say a word to each other hermione be tremble excuse

never have believe it of any of you mr filch say you be up in the astronomy tower it one oclock in the morning explain yourselves‚ it be the first time hermione have ever fail to answer a teacher question she be star at her slipper as still a a statue ‚i think ive get a good idea of whats be go on‚ say professor mcgonagall ‚it doesnt take a genius to work it out you feed draco malfoy some

here a moment‚ he lead them to the very edge of the forest hold his lamp up high he point down a narrow wind earth track that disappear into the thick black tree a light breeze lift their hair a they

now‚êthats it‚êan if anyone get in trouble send up red spark an well all come an find yeh‚êso be careful‚êlets go‚ the forest be black and silent a little way into it they reach a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid take the left path while malfoy neville and fang take the right they walk in silence their eye on the ground every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branch above lit a spot of silverblue blood on the fall leaf harry saw that hagrid look very worried ‚could a werewolf be kill the unicorns‚ harry ask ‚not fast enough‚ say hagrid ‚its not easy ter catch a unicorn theyre powerful magic creature i never know one ter be hurt before‚ they walk past a mossy tree stump harry could hear run water there must be a stream somewhere close by there be still spot of unicorn blood here and there along the wind path ‚you all right hermione‚ hagrid whisper ‚don worry it cantve go far if it this badly hurt an then well be able ter‚êget behind that tree‚ hagrid seize harry and hermione and hoist them off the path behind a tower oak he pull out an arrow and fit it into his crossbow raise it ready to fire the three of them listen something be slither over dead leaf nearby it sound like a cloak trail along the ground hagrid be squint up the dark path but after a few second the sound fade away ‚i know it ‚ he murmur ‚theres summat in here that shouldn be‚ ‚a werewolf‚ harry suggest ‚that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither‚ say hagrid grimly ‚right follow me but careful now‚ they walk more slowly ears strain for the faint sound suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely move ‚whos there‚ hagrid call ‚show yerself‚êim armed‚ and into the clearing came‚êwas it a man or a horse to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that be a horse gleam chestnut body with a long reddish tail harry and hermiones jaw drop ‚oh it you ronan‚ say hagrid in relief ‚how be yeh‚ he walk forward and shake the centaur hand ‚good evening to you hagrid‚ say ronan he have a deep sorrowful voice ‚were you go to shoot me‚ ‚cant be too careful ronan‚ say hagrid pat his crossbow ‚theres summat bad loose in this forest this be harry potter an hermione granger by the way student up at the school an this be ronan you two he a centaur ‚wed noticed‚ say hermione faintly ‚good evening‚ say ronan ‚students be you and do you learn much up at the school‚ ‚erm ‚ê‚ ‚a bit‚ say hermione timidly ‚a bit well thats something‚ ronan sigh he fling back his head and star at the sky ‚mars be bright tonight‚ ‚yeah‚ say hagrid glance up too ‚listen im glad weve run inter yeh ronan cause theres a unicorn bin hurt‚êyou see anythin‚ ronan didnt answer immediately he star unblinkingly upward then sigh again ‚always the innocent be the first victims‚ he say ‚so it have be for age past so it be now‚ ‚yeah‚ say hagrid ‚but have yeh see anythin ronan anythin unusual‚ ‚mars be bright tonight‚ ronan repeat while hagrid watch him impatiently ‚unusually bright‚ ‚yeah but i be meanin anythin unusual a bit near home say hagrid ‚so yeh havent notice anythin strange‚ yet again ronan take a while to answer at last he say ‚the forest hide many secrets‚ a movement in the tree behind ronan make hagrid raise his bow again but it be only a second centaur blackhaired and body and wilderlooking than ronan ‚hullo bane‚ say hagrid ‚all right‚ ‚good even hagrid i hope you be well‚ ‚well enough look ive jus bin askin ronan you see anythin odd in here lately theres a unicorn bin injured‚êwould yeh know anythin about it‚ bane walk over to stand next to ronan he look skyward ‚mars be bright tonight‚ he say simply ‚weve heard‚ say hagrid grumpily ‚well if either of you do see anythin let me know wont yeh well be off then‚ harry and hermione follow him out of the clearing star over their shoulder at ronan and bane until the tree block their view ‚never‚ say hagrid irritably ‚try an get a straight answer out of a centaur ruddy stargazer not interested in anythin closern the moon‚ ‚are there many of them in here‚ ask hermione ‚oh a fair few keep themselves to themselves mostly but theyre good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word theyre deep mind centaurs they know thing jus don let on much‚ ‚dyou think that be a centaur we hear earlier‚ say harry ‚did that sound like hoof to you nah if yeh ask me that be whats bin killin the unicorns‚ênever heard anythin like it before‚ they walk on through the dense dark tree harry keep look nervously over his shoulder he have the nasty feeling they be be watch he be very glad they have hagrid and his crossbow with them they have just pass a bend in the path when hermione grab hagrids arm ‚hagrid look red spark the others be in trouble‚ ‚you two wait here‚ hagrid shout ‚stay on the path ill come back for yeh‚ they hear him crash away through the undergrowth and stand look at each other very scar until they couldnt hear anything but the rustling of leaf around them ‚you dont think theyve be hurt do you‚ whisper hermione ‚i dont care if malfoy have but if somethings get neville it our fault he here in the first place‚ the minute drag by their ear seem sharp than usual harrys seem to be pick up every sigh of the wind every cracking twig what be go on where be the others at last a great crunching noise announce hagrids return malfoy neville and fang be with him hagrid be fume malfoy it seem have sneak up behind neville and grab him a a joke neville have panic and send up the spark ‚well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two be makin right be changin groups‚êneville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot im sorry‚ hagrid add in a whisper to harry ‚but hell have a hard time frightenin you an weve got ta get this done‚ so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang they walk for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path become almost impossible to follow because the tree be so thick harry think the blood seem to be get thicker there be splash on the root of a tree a though the poor creature have be thrash around in pain close by harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branch of an ancient oak ‚look ‚ê‚ he murmur hold out his arm to stop malfoy something bright white be gleam on the ground they inch close it be the unicorn all right and it be dead harry have never see anything so beautiful and sad it long slender leg be stick out at odd angle where it have fall and it mane be spread pearlywhite on the dark leave harry have take one step toward it when a slithering sound make him freeze where he stand a bush on the edge of the clearing quiver then out of the shadow a hooded figure come crawl across the ground like some stalk beast harry malfoy and fang stand transfixed the cloaked figure reach the unicorn lower it head over the wound in the animal side and begin to drink it blood ‚aaaaaaaaaargh‚ malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted‚êso do fang the hooded figure raise it head and look right at harry‚êunicorn blood be dribble down it front it get to it foot and come swiftly toward harry‚êhe couldnt move for fear then a pain like hed never felt before pierce his head it be a though his scar be on fire half blind he stagger backward he hear hoof behind him gallop and something jump clean over harry charge at the figure the pain in harrys head be so bad he fell to his knee it take a minute or two to pass when he look up the figure have go a centaur be stand over him not ronan or bane this one look younger he have whiteblond hair and a palomino body ‚are you all right‚ say the centaur pull harry to his foot ‚yes‚êthank you‚êwhat be that‚ the centaur didnt answer he have astonishingly blue eye like pale sapphire he look carefully at harry his eye linger on the scar that stand out livid on harrys forehead ‚you be the potter boy‚ he say ‚you have good get back to hagrid the forest be not safe at this time‚êespecially for you can you ride it will be quicker this way ‚my name be firenze‚ he add a he lower himself on to his front leg so that harry could clamber onto his back there be suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ronan and bane come burst through the tree their flank heave and sweaty ‚firenze‚ bane thunder ‚what be you do you have a human on your back have you no shame be you a common mule‚ ‚do you realize who this is‚ say firenze ‚this be the potter boy the quicker he leave this forest the better‚ ‚what have you be tell him‚ growl bane ‚remember firenze we be swear not to set ourselves against the heaven have we not read what be to come in the movement of the planets‚ ronan paw the ground nervously ‚im sure firenze think he be act for the best ‚ he say in his gloomy voice bane kick his back leg in anger ‚for the best what be that to do with u centaur be concern with what have be foretell it be not our business to run around like donkey after stray human in our forest‚ firenze suddenly rear on to his hind leg in anger so that harry have to grab his shoulder to stay on ‚do you not see that unicorn‚ firenze bellow at bane ‚do you not understand why it be kill or have the planet not let you in on that secret i set myself against what be lurk in this forest bane yes with human alongside me if i must‚ and firenze whisk around with harry clutch on a best he could they plunge off into the tree leave ronan and bane behind them harry didnt have a clue what be go on ‚whys bane so angry‚ he ask ‚what be that thing you save me from anyway‚ firenze slow to a walk warn harry to keep his head bow in case of lowhanging branch but do not answer harrys question they make their way through the tree in silence for so long that harry think firenze didnt want to talk to him anymore they be pass through a particularly dense patch of tree however when firenze suddenly stop ‚harry potter do you know what unicorn blood be use for‚ ‚no‚ say harry startle by the odd question ‚weve only use the horn and tail hair in potions‚ ‚that be because it be a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn‚ say firenze ‚only one who have nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you be an inch from death but at a terrible price you have slay something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a halflife a cursed life from the moment the blood touch your lips‚ harry star at the back of firenze head which be dapple silver in the moonlight ‚but whod be that desperate‚ he wonder aloud ‚if youre go to be curse forever death well isnt it‚ ‚it is‚ firenze agree ‚unless all you need be to stay alive long enough to drink something else‚êsomething that will bring you back to full strength and power‚êsomething that will mean you can never die mr potter do you know what be hide in the school at this very moment‚ ‚the sorcerer stone of course‚êthe elixir of life but i dont understand who ‚ê‚ ‚can you think of nobody who have wait many year to return to power who have clung to life await their chance‚ it be a though an iron fist have clench suddenly around harrys heart over the rustling of the tree he seem to hear once more what hagrid have tell him on the night they have meet ‚some say he die codswallop in my opinion dunno if he have enough human leave in him to die‚ ‚do you mean‚ harry croak ‚that be vol‚ ‚harry harry be you all right‚ hermione be run toward them down the path hagrid puff along behind her ‚im fine‚ say harry hardly know what he be say ‚the unicorn dead hagrid it in that clear back there‚ ‚this be where i leave you‚ firenze murmur a hagrid hurry off to examine the unicorn ‚you be safe now‚ harry slide off his back ‚good luck harry potter‚ say firenze ‚the planet have be read wrongly before now even by centaur i hope this be one of those times‚ he turn and canter back into the depth of the forest leaving harry shiver behind him ron have fall asleep in the dark common room wait for them to return he shout something about quidditch foul when harry roughly shake him awake in a matter of second though he be wideeyed a harry begin to tell him and hermione what have happen in the forest harry couldnt sit down he pace up and down in front of the fire he be still shake ‚snape want the stone for voldemort and voldemorts wait in the forest and all this time we think snape just want to get rich‚ ‚stop say the name‚ say ron in a terrified whisper a if he think voldemort could hear them harry wasnt listen ‚firenze save me but he shouldnt have do so bane be furious he be talk about interfere with what the planet say be go to happen they must show that voldemorts come back bane think firenze should have let voldemort kill me i suppose thats write in the star a well‚ ‚will you stop say the name‚ ron hiss ‚so all ive get to wait for now be snape to steal the stone‚ harry go on feverishly ‚then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off well i suppose banell be happy‚ hermione look very frightened but she have a word of comfort ‚harry everyone say dumbledores the only one youknowwho be ever afraid of with dumbledore around youknowwho wont touch you anyway who say the centaur be right it sound like fortunetelling to me and professor mcgonagall say thats a very imprecise branch of magic‚ the sky have turn light before they stop talk they go to bed exhaust their throat sore but the night surprise werent over when harry pull back his sheet he find his invisibility cloak fold neatly underneath them there be a note pin to it just in case chapter sixteen through the trapdoor in year to come harry would never quite remember how he have manage to get through his exam when he half expect voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment yet the day creep by and there could be no doubt that fluffy be still alive and well behind the locked door it be swelter hot especially in the large classroom where they do their write paper they have be give special new quill for the exam which have be bewitch with an anticheating spell they have practical exam as well professor flitwick call them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk professor mcgonagall watch them turn a mouse into a snuffbox‚êpoints be give for how pretty the snuffbox be but take away if it have whisker snape make them all nervous breathe down their neck while they try to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion harry do the best he could try to ignore the stabbing pain in his forehead which have be bother him ever since his trip into the forest neville thought harry have a bad case of exam nerve because harry couldnt sleep but the truth be that harry keep be wake by his old nightmare except that it be now bad than ever because there be a hooded figure drip blood in it maybe it be because they hadnt see what harry have see in the forest or because they didnt have scar burn on their forehead but ron and hermione didnt seem a worried about the stone a harry the idea of voldemort certainly scar them but he didnt keep visit them in dream and they be so busy with their study they didnt have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to their very last exam be history of magic one hour of answer question about batty old wizard whod invent selfstirring cauldron and theyd be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam result come out when the ghost of professor binns tell them to put down their quill and roll up their parchment harry couldnt help cheer with the rest ‚that be far easy than i think it would be‚ say hermione a they join the crowd flock out onto the sunny ground ‚i neednt have learn about the 1637 werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eager‚ hermione always like to go through their exam paper afterward but ron say this make him feel ill so they wander down to the lake and flop under a tree the weasley twin and lee jordan be tickle the tentacle of a giant squid which be bask in the warm shallow ‚no more studying‚ ron sigh happily stretch out on the grass ‚you could look more cheerful harry weve get a week before we find out how badly weve do theres no need to worry yet‚ harry be rub his forehead ‚i wish i know what this means‚ he burst out angrily ‚my scar keep hurting‚êits happen before but never as often a this‚ ‚go to madam pomfrey‚ hermione suggest ‚im not ill‚ say harry ‚i think it a warning it mean danger coming‚ ron couldnt get work up it be too hot ‚harry relax hermiones right the stone safe as long a dumbledores around anyway weve never have any proof snape find out how to get past fluffy he nearly have his leg rip off once he not go to try it again in a hurry and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid let dumbledore down‚ harry nod but he couldnt shake off a lurk feeling that there be something hed forgotten to do something important when he try to explain this hermione say ‚thats just the exam i wake up last night and be halfway through my transfiguration note before i remember wed do that one‚ harry be quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have anything to do with work though he watch an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamp in it mouth hagrid be the only one who ever send him letter hagrid would never betray dumbledore hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy never but ‚ê harry suddenly jump to his foot ‚wherere you going‚ say ron sleepily ‚ive just think of something‚ say harry he have turn white ‚weve get to go and see hagrid now‚ ‚why‚ pant hermione hurrying to keep up ‚dont you think it a bit odd‚ say harry scramble up the grassy slope ‚that what hagrid want more than anything else be a dragon and a stranger turn up who just happen to have an egg in his pocket how many people wander around with dragon egg if it against wizard law lucky they find hagrid dont you think why didnt i see it before‚ ‚what be you talk about‚ say ron but harry sprint across the ground toward the forest didnt answer hagrid be sit in an armchair outside his house his trouser and sleeve be roll up and he be shell peas into a large bowl ‚hullo‚ he say smile ‚finished yer exam get time fer a drink‚ ‚yes please‚ say ron but harry cut him off ‚no be in a hurry hagrid ive get to ask you something you know that night you win norbert what do the stranger you be play card with look like‚ ‚dunno‚ say hagrid casually ‚he wouldn take his

on them at the foot of the first set of stair they spot mrs norris skulk near the top ‚oh let kick her just this once‚ ron whisper in harrys ear but harry shake his head a they climb carefully around her mr norris turn her lamplike eye on them but didnt do anything they didnt meet anyone else until they reach the staircase up to the third floor peeve be bob halfway up loosen the carpet so that people would trip ‚whos there‚ he say suddenly a they climb toward him he narrow his wicked black eye ‚know youre there even if i cant see you be you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie‚ he rise

most certainly will‚ say peeve rise up in the air again ‚hope your business go well baron ill not bother you‚ and he scoot off ‚brilliant harry‚ whisper ron a few second later they be there outside the thirdfloor corridor‚êand the door be already ajar ‚well there you are‚ harry say quietly ‚snapes already get past fluffy‚ see the open door somehow seem to impress upon all three of them what be face them underneath the cloak harry turn to the other two ‚if you want to go back i wont blame you‚ he say ‚you can take the cloak i wont need it now‚ ‚dont be stupid‚ say ron ‚were coming‚ say hermione harry push the door open a the door creak low rumble growl meet their ear all three of the dog nose sniff madly in their direction even though it couldnt see them ‚whats that at it feet‚ hermione whisper ‚looks like a harp‚ say ron ‚snape must have leave it there‚ ‚it must wake up the moment you stop playing‚ say harry ‚well here goes‚ he put hagrids flute to his lip and blow it wasnt really a tune but from the first note the beast eye begin to droop harry hardly draw breath slowly the dog growl ceased‚êit totter on it paw and fell to it knee then it slump to the ground fast asleep ‚keep playing‚ ron warn harry a they slip out of the cloak and creep toward the trapdoor they could feel the dog hot smelly breath a they approach the giant head ‚i think well be able to pull the door open‚ say ron peering over the dog back ‚want to go first hermione‚ ‚no i dont‚ ‚all right‚ ron grit his teeth and step carefully over the dog leg he bent and pull the ring of the trapdoor which swing up and open ‚what can you see‚ hermione say anxiously ‚nothing‚êjust black‚êtheres no way of climb down well just have to drop‚ harry who be still play the flute wave at ron to get his attention and point at himself ‚you want to go first be you sure‚ say ron ‚i dont know how deep this thing go give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep‚ harry hand the flute over in the few second silence the dog growl and twitch but the moment hermione begin to play it fell back into it deep sleep harry climb over it and look down through the trapdoor there be no sign of the bottom he lower himself through the hole until he be hang on by his fingertip then he look up at ron and say ‚if anything happen to me dont follow go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore right‚ ‚right‚ say ron ‚see you in a minute i hope and harry let go cold damp air rush past him a he fell down down down and‚êflump with a funny muffle sort of thump he land on something soft he sit up and felt around his eye not use to the gloom it felt a though he be sit on some sort of plant ‚its okay‚ he call up to the light the size of a postage stamp which be the open trapdoor ‚its a soft landing you can jump‚ ron follow right away he land sprawled next to harry ‚whats this stuff‚ be his first word ‚dunno some sort of plant thing i suppose it here to break the fall come on hermione‚ the distant music stop there be a loud bark from the dog but hermione have already jump she land on harrys other side ‚we must be mile under the school she say ‚lucky this plant thing here really‚ say ron ‚lucky‚ shriek hermione ‚look at you both‚ she leap up and struggle toward a damp wall she have to struggle because the moment she have land the plant have start to twist snakelike tendril around her ankle a for harry and ron their leg have already be bind tightly in long creeper without their noticing hermione have manage to free herself before the plant get a firm grip on her now she watch in horror a the two boy fight to pull the plant off them but the more they strain against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them ‚stop moving‚ hermione order them ‚i know what this is‚êits devil snare‚ ‚oh im so glad we know what it call thats a great help‚ snarl ron lean back try to stop the plant from curl around his neck ‚shut up im try to remember how to kill it‚ say hermione ‚well hurry up i cant breathe‚ harry gasp wrestle with it a it curl around his chest ‚devils snare devil snare what do professor sprout say‚êit like the dark and the damp ‚so light a fire‚ harry choke ‚yes‚êof course‚êbut theres no wood‚ hermione cry wring her hand ‚have you go mad‚ ron bellow ‚are you a witch or not‚ ‚oh right‚ say hermione and she whip out her wand wave it mutter something and send a jet of the same bluebell flame she have use on snape at the plant in a matter of second the two boy felt it loosen it grip a it cringe away from the light and warmth wriggling and flail it unravel itself from their body and they be able to pull free ‚lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione‚ say harry a he join her by the wall wipe sweat off his face ‚yeah‚ say ron ‚and lucky harry doesnt lose his head in a crisis‚êtheres no wood honestly‚ ‚this way‚ say harry point down a stone passageway which be the only way forward all they could hear apart from their footstep be the gentle drip of water trickle down the wall the passageway slop downward and harry be remind of gringotts with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remember the dragon say to be guard vault in the wizard bank if they meet a dragon a fullygrown dragon‚ênorbert have be bad enough ‚can you hear something‚ ron whisper harry listen a soft rustling and clinking seem to be come from up ahead ‚do you think it a ghost‚ ‚i dont know sound like wing to me‚ ‚theres light ahead‚êi can see something moving‚ they reach the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber it ceiling arch high above them it be full of small jewelbright bird flutter and tumble all around the room on the opposite side of the chamber be a heavy wooden door ‚do you think theyll attack u if we cross the room‚ say ron ‚probably‚ say harry ‚they dont look very vicious but i suppose if they all swoop down at once well theres no other choice ill run‚ he take a deep breath cover his face with his arm and sprint across the room he expect to feel sharp beak and claw tear at him any second but nothing happen he reach the door untouched he pull the handle but it be lock the other two follow him they tug and heave at the door but it wouldnt budge not even when hermione try her alohomora charm ‚now what‚ say ron ‚these bird they cant be here just for decoration‚ say hermione they watch the bird soar overhead glittering‚êglittering ‚theyre not birds‚ harry say suddenly ‚theyre key wing keys‚êlook carefully so that must mean‚ he look around the chamber while the other two squint up at the flock of key ‚yes‚êlook broomstick weve get to catch the key to the door‚ ‚but there be hundred of them‚ ron examine the lock on the door ‚were look for a big oldfashioned one‚êprobably silver like the handle‚ they each seize a broomstick and kick off into the air soar into the midst of the cloud of key they grab and snatch but the bewitch key dart and dive so quickly it be almost impossible to catch one not for nothing though be harry the young seeker in a century he have a knack for spot thing other people didnt after a minute weave about through the whirl of rainbow feather he notice a large silver key that have a bent wing a if it have already be catch and stuff roughly into the keyhole ‚that one‚ he call to the others ‚that big one‚êthere‚êno there‚êwith bright blue wings‚êthe feather be all crumple on one side‚ ron go speed in the direction that harry be point crash into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom ‚weve get to close in on it‚ harry call not take his eye off the key with the damage wing ‚ron you come at it from above‚êhermione stay below and stop it from go down and ill try and catch it right now‚ ron dive hermione rocket upward the key dodge them both and harry streak after it it speed toward the wall harry lean forward and with a nasty crunching noise pin it against the stone with one hand ron and hermiones cheer echo around the high chamber they land quickly and harry ran to the door the key struggle in his hand he ram it into the lock and turned‚êit work the moment the lock have click open the key take flight again look very batter now that it have be catch twice ‚ready‚ harry ask the other two his hand on the door handle they nod he pull the door open the next chamber be so dark they couldnt see anything at all but a they step into it light suddenly flood the room to reveal an astonishing sight they be stand on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessman which be all taller than they be and carve from what look like black stone face them way across the chamber be the white piece harry ron and hermione shiver slightly‚êthe tower white chessman have no face ‚now what do we do‚ harry whisper ‚its obvious isnt it‚ say ron ‚weve get to play our way across the room‚ behind the white piece they could see another door ‚how‚ say hermione nervously ‚i think‚ say ron ‚were go to have to be chessmen‚ he walk up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight horse at once the stone sprang to life the horse paw the ground and the knight turn his helmeted head to look down at ron ‚do we‚êer‚êhave to join you to get across‚ the black knight nod ron turn to the other two ‚this need think about ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ he say i suppose weve get to take the place of three of the black pieces‚ harry and hermione stay quiet watch ron think finally he say ‚now dont be offend or anything but neither of you be that good at chess ‚ê‚ ‚were not offended‚ say harry quickly ‚just tell u what to do‚ ‚well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you 90 next to him instead of that castle‚ ‚what about you‚ ‚im go to be a knight‚ say ron the chessman seem to have be listen because at these word a knight a bishop and a castle turn their back on the white piece and walk off the board leave three empty square that harry ron and hermione take ‚white always play first in chess‚ say ron peering across the board ‚yes look‚ a white pawn have move forward two square ron start to direct the black piece they move silently wherever he send them harrys knee be tremble what if they lose ‚harry‚êmove diagonally four square to the right‚ their first real shock come when their other knight be take the white queen smash him to the floor and drag him off the board where he lay quite still facedown ‚had to let that happen‚ say ron look shake ‚leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go on‚ every time one of their men be lose the white piece show no mercy soon there be a huddle of limp black player slump along the wall twice ron only just notice in time that harry and hermione be in danger he himself dart around the board take almost a many white piece a they have lose black one ‚were nearly there‚ he mutter suddenly ‚let me think let me think‚ the white queen turn her blank face toward him ‚yes‚ say ron softly ‚its the only way ive get to be taken‚ ‚nof harry and hermione shout ‚thats chess‚ snap ron ‚youve get to make some sacrifice i take one step forward and shell take me‚êthat leave you free to checkmate the king harry‚ ‚but ‚ê‚ ‚do you want to stop snape or not‚ ‚ron ‚ê‚ ‚look if you dont hurry up hell already have the stone‚ there be no alternative ‚ready‚ ron call his face pale but determine ‚here i go‚ênow dont hang around once youve won‚ he step forward and the white queen pounce

move three space to the leave the white king take off his crown and throw it at harrys foot they have win the chessman part and bow leave the door ahead clear with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charge through the door and up the next passageway ‚what if he ‚ê‚ ‚hell be all right‚ say harry try to convince himself ‚what do you reckon next‚ ‚weve have sprout that be the devil snare flitwick mustve put charm on the key mcgonagall transfigure the chessman to make them alive that leave quirrells spell and snapes‚ they have reach another door ‚all right‚ harry whisper ‚go on‚ harry push it open a disgust smell fill their nostril make both of them pull their robe up over their nose eye water they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even large than the one they have tackle out cold with a bloody lump on it head ‚im glad we didnt have to fight that one‚ harry whisper a they step carefully over one of it massive legs ‚come on i cant breathe‚ he pull open the next door both of them hardly dare to look at what come next‚êbut there be nothing very frighten in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottle stand on it in a line ‚snapes‚ say harry ‚what do we have to do‚ they step over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway it wasnt ordinary fire either it be purple at the same instant black flame shoot up in the doorway lead onward they be trap ‚look‚ hermione seize a roll of paper lie next to the bottle harry look over her shoulder to read it danger lie before you while safety lie behind two of u will

‚but how do we know which to drink‚ ‚give me a minute‚ hermione read the paper several time then she walk up and down the line of bottle mutter to herself and point at them at last she clap her hand ‚got it‚ she say ‚the small bottle will get u through the black fire‚êtoward the stone‚ harry look at the tiny bottle ‚theres only enough there for one of us‚ he say ‚thats hardly one swallow‚ they look at each other ‚which one will get you back through the purple flames‚ hermione point at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line ‚you drink that‚ say harry ‚no listen get back and get ron grab broom from the flyingkey room theyll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy‚êgo straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him i might be able to hold snape off for a while

dash at harry and throw her arm around him ‚hermione‚ ‚harry‚êyoure a great wizard you know‚ ‚im not as good a you‚ say harry very embarrassed a she let go of him ‚me‚ say hermione ‚books and cleverness there be more important things‚êfriendship and bravery and‚êoh harry‚êbe careful‚ ‚you drink first‚ say harry ‚you be sure which be which arent you‚ ‚positive‚ say hermione she take a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shudder ‚its not poison‚ say harry anxiously ‚no‚êbut it like ice‚ ‚quick go before it wear off‚ ‚good luck‚êtake care‚ ‚go‚ hermione turn and walk straight through the purple fire harry take a deep breath and pick up the small bottle he turn to face the black flame ‚here i come‚ he say and he drain the little bottle in one gulp it be indeed a though ice be flood his body he put the bottle down and walk forward he brace himself saw the black flame lick his body but couldnt feel them‚êfor a moment he could see nothing but dark fire‚êthen he be on the other side in the last chamber there be already someone there‚êbut it wasnt snape it wasnt even voldemort chapter seventeen the man with two face it be quirrell ‚you‚ gasp harry quirrell smile his face wasnt twitch at all ‚me‚ he say calmly ‚i wonder whether id be meet you here potter‚ ‚but i thought‚êsnape ‚ê‚ ‚severus‚ quirrell laugh and it wasnt his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp ‚yes severus do seem the type doesnt he so useful to have him swoop around like an overgrown bat next to him who would suspect pppoor ststuttering pprofessor quirrell‚ harry couldnt take it in this couldnt be true it couldnt ‚but snape try to kill me‚ ‚no no no i try to kill you your friend miss granger accidentally knock me over a she rush to set fire to snape at that quidditch match she break my eye contact with you another few second and id have get you off that broom id have manage it before then if snape hadnt be mutter a countercurse try to save you‚ ‚snape be try to save me‚ ‚of

watch all the other teacher think snape be try to stop gryffindor from win he do make himself unpopular and what a waste of time when after all that im go to kill you tonight‚ quirrell snap his finger rope spring out of thin air and wrap themselves tightly around harry ‚youre too nosy to live potter scurry around the school on halloween like that for all i know youd see me come to look at what be guard the stone‚ ‚you let the troll in‚ ‚certainly i have a special gift with trolls‚êyou must have see what i do to the one in the chamber back there unfortunately while everyone else be run around look for it snape who already suspect me go straight to the third floor to head me off‚êand not only do my troll fail to beat you to death that threeheaded dog didnt even manage to bite snapes leg off properly ‚now wait quietly potter i need to examine this interesting mirror it be only then that harry realize what be stand behind quirrell it be the mirror of erised ‚this mirror be the key to find the stone‚ quirrell murmur tap his way around the frame ‚trust dumbledore to come up with something like this but hes in london ill be far away by the time he get back‚ all harry could think of do be to keep quirrell talk and stop him from concentrate on the mirror ‚i saw you and snape in the forest ‚ê‚ he blurt out ‚yes‚ say quirrell idly walk around the mirror to look at the back ‚he be on to me by that time try to find out how far id get he suspect me all along try to frighten me‚êas though he could when i have lord voldemort on my side‚ quirrell come back out from behind the mirror and star hungrily into it ‚i see the stone im present it to my master but where be it‚ harry struggle against the rope bind him but they didnt give he have to keep quirrell from give his whole attention to the mirror ‚but snape always seem to hate me so much‚ ‚oh he does‚ say quirrell casually ‚heavens yes he be at hogwarts with your father didnt you know they loathe each other but he never want you dead‚ ‚but i heard you a few day ago sobbing‚êi thought snape be threaten you‚ for the first time a spasm of fear flit across quirrells face ‚sometimes‚ he say ‚i find it hard to follow my master instructions‚êhe be a great wizard and i be weak ‚ê‚ ‚you mean he be there in the classroom with you‚ harry gasp ‚he be with me wherever i go‚ say quirrell quietly ‚i meet him when i travel around the world a foolish young man i be then full of ridiculous idea about good and evil lord voldemort show me how wrong i be there be no good and evil there be only power and those too weak to seek it since then i have serve him faithfully although i have let him down many time he have have to be very hard on me‚ quirrell shiver suddenly ‚he do not forgive mistake easily when i fail to steal the stone from gringotts he be most displeased he punish me decide he would have to keep a close watch on me‚ quirrells voice trail away harry be remember his trip to diagon alley how could he have be so stupid hed see quirrell there that very day shake hand with him in the leaky cauldron quirrell curse under his breath ‚i dont understand be the stone inside the mirror should i break it‚ harrys mind be race what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he think be to find the stone before quirrell do so if i look in the mirror i should see myseff find it‚êwhich mean ill see where it hidden but how can i look without quirrell realize what im up to he try to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the rope around his ankle be too tight he trip and fell over quirrell ignore him he be still talk to himself ‚what do this mirror do how do it work help me master‚ and to harry horror a voice answer and the voice seem to come from quirrell himself ‚use the boy use the boy‚ quirrell round on harry ‚yes‚êpotter‚êcome here‚ he clap his hand once and the rope bind harry fell off harry get slowly to his foot ‚come here‚ quirrell repeat ‚look in the mirror and tell me what you see‚ harry walk toward him i must lie he think desperately i must look and lie about what i see thats all quirrell move close behind him harry breathe in the funny smell that seem to come from quirrells turban he close his eye step in front of the mirror and open them again he saw his reflection pale and scaredlooking at first but a moment later the reflection smile at him it put it hand into it pocket and pull out a bloodred stone it wink and put the stone back in it pocket‚êand a it do so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket somehow‚êincredibly‚êhed gotten the stone ‚well‚ say quirrell impatiently ‚what do you see‚ harry screw up his courage ‚i see myself shake hand with dumbledore‚ he invent ‚i‚êive win the house cup for gryffindor‚ quirrell curse again ‚get out of the way‚ he say a harry move aside he felt the sorcerer stone against his leg dare he make a break for it but he hadnt walked five pace before a high voice

‚master you be not strong enough‚ ‚i have strength enough for this‚ harry felt a if devil snare be root him to the spot he couldnt move a muscle petrify he watch a quirrell reach up and begin to unwrap his turban what be go on the turban fell away quirrells head look strangely small without it then he turn slowly on the spot harry would have scream but he couldnt make a sound where there should have be a back to quirrells head there be a face the most terrible face harry have ever see it be chalk white with glare red eye and slit for nostril like a snake ‚harry potter‚ it whisper harry try to take a step backward but his legs wouldnt move ‚see what i have become‚ the face say ‚mere shadow and vapor i have form only when i can share anothers body but there have always be those willing to let me into their heart and mind unicorn blood have strengthen me these past week you saw faithful quirrell drink it for me in the forest and once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a body of my own now why dont you give me that stone in your pocket‚ so he know the feeling suddenly surge back into harrys leg he stumble backward ‚dont be a fool‚ snarl the face ‚better

try to protect you now give me the stone unless you want her to have die in vain‚ ‚never‚ harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort scream ‚seize him‚ and the next second harry felt quirrells hand close on his wrist at once a needlesharp pain sear across harrys scar his head felt a though it be about to split in two he yell struggle with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him the pain in his head lessened‚êhe look around wildly to see where quirrell have go and saw him hunch in pain look at his fingers‚êthey be blister before his eye ‚seize him seize him‚ shriek voldemort again and quirrell lunge knock harry clean off his foot land on top of him both hand around harrys neck‚êharrys scar be almost blind him with pain yet he could see quirrell howl in agony ‚master i can not hold him‚êmy hands‚êmy hands‚ and quirrell though pin harry to the ground with his knee let go of his neck and star bewilder at his own palms‚êharry could see they look burn raw red and shiny ‚then kill him fool and be done‚ screeched voldemort quirrell raise his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reach up and grab quirrells face ‚ê ‚aaaargh‚ quirrell roll off

do a curse harry jump to his foot catch quirrell by the arm and hung on as tight a he could quirrell scream and try to throw harry off‚êthe pain in harrys head be building‚êhe couldnt see‚êhe could only hear quirrells terrible shriek and voldemorts yell of ‚kill him kill him‚ and other voice maybe in harrys own head cry ‚harry harry‚ he felt quirrells arm wrench from his grasp know all be lose and fell into blackness down down down something gold be glint just above him the snitch he try to catch it but his arm be too heavy he blink it wasnt the snitch at all it be a pair of glass how strange he blink again the smile face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him ‚good afternoon harry‚ say dumbledore harry star at him then he remember ‚sir the stone it be quirrell he get the stone sir quick ‚ê‚ ‚calm yourself dear boy you be a little behind the times‚ say dumbledore ‚quirrell do not have the stone‚ ‚then who do sir i ‚ê‚ ‚harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me throw out harry swallow and look around him he realize he must be in the hospital wing he be lie in a bed with white linen sheet and next to him be a table pile high with what look like half the candy shop ‚tokens from your friend and admirers‚ say dumbledore beam ‚what happen down in the dungeon between you and professor quirrell be a complete secret so naturally the whole school know i believe your friend mister fred and george weasley be responsible for try to send you a toilet seat no doubt they think it would amuse you madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it‚ ‚how long have i be in here‚ ‚three day mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieve you have come round they have be extremely worried‚ ‚but sit the stone i see you be not to be distract very well the stone professor quirrell do not manage to take it from you i arrive in time to prevent that although you be do very well on your own i must say ‚you get there you get hermiones owl‚ ‚we must have cross in midair no sooner have i reach london than it become clear to me that the place i should be be the one i have just leave i arrive just in time to pull quirrell off you‚ ‚it be you‚ ‚i fear i might be too late‚ ‚you nearly be i couldnt have keep him off the stone much longer ‚ê‚ ‚not the stone boy you‚êthe effort involve nearly kill you for one terrible moment there i be afraid it have a for the stone it have be destroyed‚ ‚destroyed‚ say harry blankly ‚but your friend‚ênicolas flamel ‚ê‚ ‚oh you know about nicolas‚ say dumbledore sound quite delight ‚you do do the thing properly didnt you well nicolas and i have have a little chat and agree it all for the best‚ ‚but that mean he and his wife will die wont they‚ ‚they have enough elixir store to set their affair in order and then yes they will die‚ dumbledore smile at the look of amazement on harrys face ‚to one as young a you im sure it seem incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really be like go to bed after a very very long day after all to the wellorganized mind death be but the next great adventure you know the stone be really not such a wonderful thing a much money and life a you could want the two thing most human being would choose above all‚êthe trouble be human do have a knack of choose precisely those thing that be worst for them‚ harry lay there lose for word dumbledore hum a little and smile at the ceiling ‚sir‚ say harry ‚ive be think sir‚êeven if the stone go vol i mean youknowwho ‚ê‚ ‚call him voldemort harry always use the proper name for thing fear of a name increase fear of the thing itself‚ ‚yes sir well voldemorts go to try other way of come back isnt he i mean he hasnt go have he‚ ‚no harry he have not he be still out there somewhere perhaps look for another body to share not be truly alive he can not be kill he leave quirrell to die he show just as little mercy to his follower a his enemy nevertheless harry while you may only have delay his return to power it will merely take someone else who be prepare to fight what seem a losing battle next time‚êand if he be delay again and again why he may never return to power‚ harry nod but stop quickly because it make his head hurt then he say ‚sir there be some other thing id like to know if you can tell me thing i want to know the truth about‚ ‚the truth‚ dumbledore sigh ‚it be a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treat with great caution however i shall answer your question unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg youll forgive me i shall not of course lie‚ ‚well voldemort say that he only kill my mother because she try to stop him from kill me but why would he want to kill me in the first place‚ dumbledore sigh very deeply this time ‚alas the first thing you ask me i can not tell you not today not now you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry when you be old i know you hate to hear this when you be ready you will know‚ and harry know it would be no good to argue ‚but why couldnt quirrell touch me‚ ‚your mother die to save you if there be one thing voldemort can not understand it be love he didnt realize that love as powerful a your mother for you leave it own mark not a scar no visible sign to have be love so deeply even though the person who love u be go will give u some protection forever it be in your very skin quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition share his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason it be agony to touch a person mark by something so good‚ dumbledore now become very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which give harry time to dry his eye on the sheet when he have find his voice again harry say ‚and the invisibility cloak‚êdo you know who send it to me‚ ‚ah‚êyour father happen to leave it in my possession and i think you might like it‚ dumbledores eye twinkle ‚useful thing your father use it mainly for sneak off to the kitchen to steal food when he be here‚ ‚and there something else‚ ‚fire away‚ ‚quirrell say snape ‚ê‚ ‚professor snape harry‚ ‚yes him‚êquirrell say he hat me because he hat my father be that true‚ ‚well they do rather detest each other not unlike yourself and mr malfoy and then your father do something snape could never forgive‚ ‚what‚ ‚he save his life‚ ‚what‚ ‚yes‚ say dumbledore dreamily ‚funny the way people mind work isnt it professor snape couldnt bear be in your father debt i do believe he work so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even then he could go back to hat your father memory in peace‚ harry try to understand this but it make his head pound so he stop ‚and sir theres one more thing‚ ‚just the one‚ ‚how do i get the stone out of the mirror‚ ‚ah now im glad you ask me that it be one of my more brilliant idea and between you and me thats say something you see only one who want to find the stone‚êfind it but not use it‚êwould be able to get it otherwise theyd just see themselves make gold or drinking elixir of life my brain surprise even me sometimes now enough question i suggest you make a start on these sweet ah bettie botts every flavor bean i be unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one and since then im afraid ive rather lose my liking for them‚êbut i think ill be safe with a nice toffee dont you‚ he smile and pop the goldenbrown bean into his mouth then he choke and say ‚alas ear wax‚ madam pomfrey the nurse be a nice woman but very strict ‚just five minutes‚ harry plead ‚absolutely not‚ ‚you let professor dumbledore in‚ ‚well of course that be the headmaster quite different you need rest‚ ‚i be rest look lie down and everything oh go on madam pomfrey‚ ‚oh very well‚ she say ‚but five minute only‚ and she let ron and hermione in ‚harry‚ hermione look ready to fling her arm around him again but harry be glad she hold herself in a his head be still very sore ‚oh harry we be sure you be go to‚êdumbledore be so worried ‚ê‚ ‚the whole school talk about it‚ say ron ‚what really happened‚ it be one of those rare occasion when the true story be even more strange and excite than the wild rumor harry tell them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort ron and hermione be a very good audience they gasp in all the right place and when harry tell them what be under quirrells turban hermione scream out loud ‚so the stone gone‚ say ron finally ‚flamels just go to die‚ ‚thats what i say but dumbledore think that‚êwhat be it‚êto the wellorganized mind death be but the next great adventure ‚i always say he be off his rocker‚ say ron look quite impress at how crazy his hero be ‚so what happen to you two‚ say harry ‚well i get back all right‚ say hermione ‚i bring ron
